<p>Sometimes, the nature of our work requires that we use a large <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/">computer monitor</a> even when going on business or work trips and that’s where the big question comes knocking, how do I transport my monitor without damaging it?</p>



<p>A friend told me that he packs it along with his clothes, and when I asked the question of what if your bag gets mishandled because the loading officer had no idea that your monitor was in your bag and sadly, it gets scratched or broken. Funny enough, my friend suggested replacing the monitor and it got me thinking, how many times do I have to replace my monitor especially if I have to travel a lot (seriously, I don’t even want to think about it).&nbsp;Good enough, I found a better alternative, a computer monitor travel bag.</p>



<p>A computer monitor travel bag is safer and more convenient for transporting computer monitors through the rigors of traveling and did I mention that it is more professional than using a traveling bag meant for your clothes? A computer monitor travel bag is well designed to provide cushioning and safety for your gadgets while you’re on the move. It also has other pockets for storing other gadgets and it is easy to identify and carry.</p>



<p>If you’re in the market searching for the best computer monitor travel bag, then check out our top 3 picks for the best computer travel bag. These travel bags are durable and can cater to different sizes of monitors.</p>

<p>Despite being very careful with your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/">computer monitor</a>,&nbsp;you might encounter some problems that leave you with the question; <strong><em>can a computer monitor screen be Repaired?</em></strong> Maybe, read on.</p>



<p>Using a computer monitor screen is easy, but your computer monitor might begin to malfunction, and what seems so easy can begin to be a challenge, and, sometimes, it can get frustrating and outright annoying.&nbsp; Like I explained earlier, some mishaps are bound to happen (or not) with our computer monitor screens, and while some can be caused by a moment of carelessness, some happen without you doing anything to trigger it.</p>



<p>The possibility of your computer monitor screen being repaired depends on the fault that it has, and in some situations, the extent of the malfunctioning.&nbsp;However, in some situations, your cherished monitor will have to be replaced with something better.</p>



<p>Common faults or mishaps that can be repaired on your computer monitor screen include dead pixels, black screen (due to dead backlight or flickers), stuttering, flickers, buzzing, and random shut-off among others.</p>



<p>Such faults are sometimes due to a design failure or poor structuring of the computer monitor screen, and while it can be repaired if it has such fault,&nbsp;I’ll strongly advise that you return it to the manufacturer if your monitor has a valid warranty because trying to fix such issues by yourself might void your warranty. If you intend to fix it by yourself, I’ll also advise that you seek the help of an expert in such a field.</p>



<p>However, under circumstances where your computer monitor screen gets cracked, it cannot be repaired. If the crack on the computer monitor screen is extreme and cannot be fixed, then you will have to replace it or get a new one.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> &#8211; Technically yes, but be careful with the power requirements.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="844" height="678" src="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/computer-power-cord.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1961"/></figure>



<p>There are different brands that produce <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/">computer monitor</a> power cords and, a lot of them are highly functional and durable but the question remains “<strong>are computer monitor</strong> <strong>power cords universal?”</strong> For some reason, you might have different power cords lying around that are designed for different computer monitors and you’re faced with the question of interchanging them to function with different hardware. If you’ve faced this challenge, then keep reading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The simple answer to this million-dollar question is “<strong>if it fits, it will work</strong>”! This goes on to say that computer monitor power cords are universal although, it is advisable to use a computer monitor power cord whose power gauge is similar (or almost similar) to the device that you intend to use it on.</p>



<p>However, this is not a trivial issue because most computer monitor power cords are designed to convert power to a capacity that is suitable for the monitor, and only on rare occasions do computer monitors have to contradict power gauge to the point of not functioning with a different power cable (I haven’t encountered or heard of any).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In conclusion, most computer monitor power cords are standardized, and although there are no actual standards listed for a monitor or hardware, <strong>it is ideal for safety reasons to use a power cord that is rated for the correct current</strong>. In other words, computer monitor power cords are universal as long as the capacity of the power or current is adequate for the hardware.</p>



<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1602937389397"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What does a computer monitor power cord do?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">A computer monitor power cord is designed to provide power to the computer monitor and other hardware or components within a computer. Simply put, it is the power transporter and in its absence, activities will have to be put on hold.</p> </div> </div>

<p>There isn’t any 4K streaming router in the market that can match up to the performances of the Nighthawk R9000. When it comes to the layout, this router is one of the sleekest in the market, bolstered further by four high-performance antennas.</p>



<p>The best thing about this router is its 4K streaming compatibility followed by VR readiness. Most importantly, it is the existing Tri-Band technology that qualifies Nighthawk R9000 as one of the best gadgets in the market.

<p>There isn’t one but several reasons for adding this gadget to our list. While the quad-core processor is a significant addition, the availability of 6 gig Ethernet ports and the exceptional 10 gig SFP+ slot further add to the credibility. In addition to that, this 4K streaming router also boasts of certain productivity-enhancing features like Beamforming+ support, Dynamic QoS, smart parental controls, and Alexa-powered voice maneuvering technology.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Enhanced VR Readiness</li><li>Tri-Band technology</li><li>Capable of 45 simultaneous connections</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Restrictive pricing</li></ul>

<p>For budget-centric 4K streamers, the Nighthawk R7000 from Netgear is the best possible selection. While there aren’t many performance tradeoffs when it comes to making it more affordable as compared to some of the other products on our list, it comes with a slightly underpowered dual-core processor that isn’t as equipped as the one in the Nighthawk R9000.</p>



<p>However, the standout attributes include the extensive wireless coverage of up to 1800sqft followed by a cumulative speed that can go up to 1900mbps. Despite being a dual-band router, the processing throughput is at par with the tri-band contemporaries. This router is capable of connecting 30 devices at once while ensuring the best band allotment for the concerned gadgets, depending on the distance.</p>



<p>When it comes to the best set of features, this affordable router from Netgear comes equipped with four gig Ethernet ports for faster, wired connections. Apart from that, Netgear ensures a seamless app-based setup followed by the inclusion of parental control and the class-leading Armor support for keeping network-specific threats at bay.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Excellent Beamforming+ capabilities</li><li>ReadySHARE setup for data backup</li><li>Exceptional security standards</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Might experience signal drops</li></ul>



<p>Editors’ Rating &#8211; 4 out of 5</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F0DD0I6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=computersta08-20&amp;linkId=7480026b3c7d019f8429b44d3cac229c&amp;language=en_US">Check it out on Amazon</a></strong></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Each one of the three routers is equipped with class-leading wireless technologies that make room for faster and lag-free 4K streaming. However, the final selection depends on your budget and personal or professional preferences. For instance, if you are seeking the highest possible speeds, responsive UI, VR readiness, and a brand-centric validation, the Netgear Nighthawk R9000 is the one to consider.</p>



<p>Then again, if your secondary requirement is diversified wired connectivity, the Linksys Max-Stream is the best wireless router for streaming 4K. Lastly, for the budget users who aren’t exactly upbeat about tri-band technologies, the Nighthawk R7000 from Netgear is the perfect buying option.</p>



<p>If for some crazy reason these amazing options were not what you were looking for, then you should feel free to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=computersta08-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=c2e25040ca6781cd6799c808f988d6d8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Wireless Router for Streaming 4K">head on over to Amazon</a> and continue your search there.</p>

<p>A lot of times, we pay scant attention to the most important input device that holds our productivity in its hands; our keyboard.</p>



<p>What’s worse is the fact that it is a mechanical keyboard. I must confess that most time the way it is treated makes me want to be a “mechanical keyboard rights activist”!</p>



<p>Dear esteemed owner of <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/keyboards/">an awesome mechanical keyboard</a>, like every other piece of technology, it gets dirty as a result of constant use and other activities that might have caused delicious soda to spill on it. I’m sure you like the way it is functional and as a possession that serves you diligently, it should be properly cleaned from time to time to help it last longer and serve you better.</p>



<p>Here’s a guide on how to clean a mechanical keyboard.</p>



<h2>The Cleaning Process</h2>



<p>Most importantly, the type of cleaning process to indulge in is based on how often you clean your mechanical keyboard, as well as your reason for cleaning your mechanical keyboard in the first place. Once this factor has been identified, the useful tools that will aid the process can be easily sorted. The tools that will be used will be listed in different stages.</p>



<h3>Routine-Based Cleaning</h3>



<p>Routine-based cleaning is usually time-based, less tasking, and requires a few simple tools. In the same vein, it also be called a preventive action because you’re cleaning to prevent dust and food particles from settling in your keyboard.</p>



<h4>Cleaning Agents</h4>



<p>A Vacuum cleaner, a cotton swab or a dry piece of clothing or towel, mild alcohol, wipes.</p>



<h4>The Task</h4>



<ul><li>Firstly, unplug your mechanical keyboard. Obvious to the fact that it is entirely dangerous to clean your keyboard while it is still plugged in, you might want to do the cleaning a bit far from your PC. This would help you avoid getting dust into other parts of the computer.</li><li>The spaces between each row of keys should be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner. A cotton swipe can be improvised for this.</li><li>Dab a small amount of alcohol on a wipe and use it to clean every part of the keyboard thoroughly. This is to disinfect the keyboard from germs.</li><li>Wipe thoroughly with a dry cloth.</li></ul>



<h3>Deep Cleaning</h3>



<p>Take it a step higher with an occasional deep cleaning process for your  Mechanical keyboard.  Your device can begin to malfunction if the stay of some stubborn particles are prolonged.  </p>



<h4>Cleaning Agents</h4>



<p>A keycap puller, a keycap cleaning solution or a mild soap, warm water, a small thin brush, cotton swab, bowl, wipes, mild alcohol, and dry clothes.</p>



<h4>The Task</h4>



<ul><li>Unplug your Mechanical Keyboard. This process is more time consuming and will employ a fair amount of water, unlike the routine Based Cleaning. It is advisable to unplug your keyboard to prevent more complicated damage.</li><li>Take a clear and bold picture of your keyboard. This is to help you identify the position of each keycap when reassembling it.</li><li>Pull off all the keycaps using a keycap puller. You can do this manually (with your bare hands) but it’s not the best way.</li><li>Place the removed keycaps in a bowl of warm water and add your preferred keycap cleaning solution or a mild soap. Soak deeply for seven hours or more. When removed, leave the keycaps to air dry.</li><li>Use a thin brush or a cotton swab to gently clean the keyboard rows and each corner around the switches. Clean carefully and thoroughly, picking out debris and any unwanted particle on the keyboard. You can also use an antistatic vacuum cleaner designed for cleaning keyboards. Be careful when working around the switches to prevent damaging them. Air dry after cleaning.</li><li>Cover the keyboard with a neat piece of clothing to prevent dust from settling on it while waiting for the keycaps to dry.</li><li>With the aid of the photograph taken earlier, carefully replace the dried keycaps correctly on each switch.</li><li>•After successfully fixing the keycaps, dab a small amount of mild alcohol on a wipe and use it to clean the framed surface of the keyboard and the keycaps too. This action is to disinfect the keyboard from germs.</li><li>Use a dry neat cloth to clean the keyboard again after final assembly.</li></ul>



<h3>Intensive Cleaning</h3>



<p>Perhaps you held a little party for your friends that went wild and your mechanical keyboard had to play host to the food, drinks, and some vomit (I hope it forgives you for this). Before you consider trashing your mechanical keyboard, don&#8217;t be in a hurry! It can be fixed and the internal and external mishap can be undone but please try and be more careful next time.</p>



<h4>Cleaning agents</h4>



<p>A keycap puller, a keycap cleaning solution, mild soap, warm water, a small thin brush, cotton swab, bowl, wipes alcohol, dry neat cloth, and a keycap cleaning machine (ultrasonic powered cleaner).</p>



<h4>The Task</h4>



<ul><li>Unplug your mechanical keyboard. This process is more time consuming and very tasking. It is advisable to unplug your keyboard to effectively carry out the task and prevent more complicated damage.</li><li>Take a clear and bold picture of your keyboard, the switches, and every moment when you unscrew or disassemble a part because this will help you to identify the position of each key when reassembling it.</li><li>Pull off all the keycaps using a keycap puller. However, you can do this manually (with your bare hands) but it’s not ideal!</li><li>Put the keycaps in small sections into the ultrasonic cleaning machine, add a keycap cleaning solution, and strictly adhere to the instructions on how to use it. Do this with all keycaps. If you don’t want to use an ultrasonic cleaner, you can use a keycap solution. Soak all the keycaps for seven hours or more in warm water and add your preferred keycap cleaning solution. Leave the keycaps to air dry after they are clean.</li><li>Carefully lay the keycaps to dry slowly with the plus stem facing up (if cleaned with an ultrasonic powered cleaner).</li><li>This is the trickiest part of this cleaning process and it’s unscrewing the keyboard. Place all the screws grouped in an easily identifiable manner. You can write down the screw positions for easy assembling.</li><li>After disassembling, carefully separate the frame from the circuit board and the switchboard. Carefully cover the circuit board with a dry cloth to prevent dust.</li><li>Scrub the keyboard with a thin brush, mild soap and water to remove grime or thicker dirt. Clean the frame with a dry cloth and leave it to air dry.</li><li>Carefully place the switchboard on a clean surface and clean carefully with a cotton swab or a thin brush. Clean the rows and the corners around the switch carefully and air dry.</li><li>Ensure that there is no dirt or unwanted particle on the circuit board. If found, clean carefully with a cotton swab, cleaning only affected areas. Do this carefully to avoid damaging it.</li><li>Bring together all the dry disassembled parts of the mechanical keyboard and carefully reassemble. Make sure the screws are tight and make sure everything is in the right position. You can refer to the photographs taken at different stages of the cleaning process or you can make a video before disassembling to help you identify the process better.</li><li>Dab a small amount of mild alcohol on a wipe and clean the exposed areas of the assembled keyboard, disinfecting it from germs.</li><li>Use a dry neat cloth to clean it again and test it to be sure everything is in good shape.</li></ul>



<h2>Further Cleaning Tips</h2>



<ul><li>It is advisable to air dry instead of using compressed or canned air. They are cold and do not use room temperature air and could damage your keyboard.</li><li>Do not use a paper towel to clean your Mechanical keyboard because some particles might be deposited on the keyboard, thus defeating the overall goal of the cleaning process.</li><li>If a spillage occurs, carefully flip it over and immediately clean the affected area with a dry cloth. Secondly, leave to air before testing it again. Further more, you can also pull the keycaps and clean thoroughly as instructed in either the second or third cleaning process above. However, in the case of a damaged switch, you can replace it or ask the keyboard manufacturer for help before doing anything else.</li><li> Dust should not cover your keyboard before cleaning because you can engage in routine-based cleaning which is less time consuming and very easy to do.</li><li>Avoid getting water or drinks close to your keyboard to avoid spillage and do not eat directly above the keyboard to prevent food particles from being deposited on it.</li><li>You can use an antistatic or hand vacuum cleaner. </li><li>Cleaning with a denture tablet is more preferred to a mild soap because it is less greasy.</li><li>Before deep cleaning or intensively cleaning a mechanical keyboard, check your keyboard manual as some keyboards come with cleaning instructions. Adhere to it to avoid making your warranty void.</li></ul>



<h2> Conclusion</h2>



<p>Cleaning a mechanical keyboard contributes to its durability and functional responsiveness. In other words, please engage in regular  keyboard maintenance. Feel free to improvise materials or tools with options that will not damage the system.</p>
