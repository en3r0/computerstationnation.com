<p>Sometimes, the nature of our work requires that we use a large <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/">computer monitor</a> even when going on business or work trips and that’s where the big question comes knocking,<strong> how do I transport my monitor without damaging it?</strong></p>



<p>A friend told me that he packs it along with his clothes, and when I asked the question of what if your bag gets mishandled because the loading officer had no idea that your monitor was in your bag and sadly, it gets scratched or broken. </p>



<p>Funny enough, my friend suggested replacing the monitor and it got me thinking, how many times do I have to replace my monitor especially if I have to travel a lot (seriously, I don’t even want to think about it).&nbsp;Good enough, I found a better alternative, a computer monitor travel bag.</p>

<p>Despite being very careful with your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/">computer monitor</a>,&nbsp;you might encounter some problems that leave you with the question; <strong><em>can a computer monitor screen be Repaired?</em></strong> Maybe, read on.</p>



<p>Using a computer monitor screen is easy, but your computer monitor might begin to malfunction, and what seems so easy can begin to be a challenge, and, sometimes, it can get frustrating and outright annoying.&nbsp; Like I explained earlier, some mishaps are bound to happen (or not) with our computer monitor screens, and while some can be caused by a moment of carelessness, some happen without you doing anything to trigger it.</p>



<p>The possibility of your computer monitor screen being repaired depends on the fault that it has, and in some situations, the extent of the malfunctioning.&nbsp;However, in some situations, your cherished monitor will have to be replaced with something better.</p>



<p>Common faults or mishaps that can be repaired on your computer monitor screen include dead pixels, black screen (due to dead backlight or flickers), stuttering, flickers, buzzing, and random shut-off among others.</p>



<p>Such faults are sometimes due to a design failure or poor structuring of the computer monitor screen, and while it can be repaired if it has such fault,&nbsp;I’ll strongly advise that you return it to the manufacturer if your monitor has a valid warranty because trying to fix such issues by yourself might void your warranty. If you intend to fix it by yourself, I’ll also advise that you seek the help of an expert in such a field.</p>



<p>However, under circumstances where your computer monitor screen gets cracked, it cannot be repaired. If the crack on the computer monitor screen is extreme and cannot be fixed, then you will have to replace it or get a new one.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> &#8211; Technically yes, but be careful with the power requirements.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="844" height="678" src="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/computer-power-cord.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1961"/></figure>



<p>There are different brands that produce <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/">computer monitor</a> power cords and, a lot of them are highly functional and durable but the question remains “<strong>are computer monitor</strong> <strong>power cords universal?”</strong> For some reason, you might have different power cords lying around that are designed for different computer monitors and you’re faced with the question of interchanging them to function with different hardware. If you’ve faced this challenge, then keep reading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The simple answer to this million-dollar question is “<strong>if it fits, it will work</strong>”! This goes on to say that computer monitor power cords are universal although, it is advisable to use a computer monitor power cord whose power gauge is similar (or almost similar) to the device that you intend to use it on.</p>



<p>However, this is not a trivial issue because most computer monitor power cords are designed to convert power to a capacity that is suitable for the monitor, and only on rare occasions do computer monitors have to contradict power gauge to the point of not functioning with a different power cable (I haven’t encountered or heard of any).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In conclusion, most computer monitor power cords are standardized, and although there are no actual standards listed for a monitor or hardware, <strong>it is ideal for safety reasons to use a power cord that is rated for the correct current</strong>. In other words, computer monitor power cords are universal as long as the capacity of the power or current is adequate for the hardware.</p>



<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1602937389397"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What does a computer monitor power cord do?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">A computer monitor power cord is designed to provide power to the computer monitor and other hardware or components within a computer. Simply put, it is the power transporter and in its absence, activities will have to be put on hold.</p> </div> </div>

<p>There isn’t any 4K streaming router in the market that can match up to the performances of the Nighthawk R9000. When it comes to the layout, this router is one of the sleekest in the market, bolstered further by four high-performance antennas.</p>



<p>The best thing about this router is its 4K streaming compatibility followed by VR readiness. Most importantly, it is the existing Tri-Band technology that qualifies Nighthawk R9000 as one of the best gadgets in the market.

While the quad-core processor is a significant addition, the availability of 6 gig Ethernet ports and the exceptional 10 gig SFP+ slot further add to the credibility. In addition to that, this 4K streaming router also boasts of certain productivity-enhancing features like Beamforming+ support, Dynamic QoS, smart parental controls, and Alexa-powered voice maneuvering technology.</p>

<ul><li>Enhanced VR Readiness</li><li>Tri-Band technology</li><li>Capable of 45 simultaneous connections</li></ul>

<p>If you are seeking the best wireless router for streaming 4K, it is appropriate to go with the Linksys Max-Stream EA9500, boasting of the AC5400 standards. Besides offering extensive coverage of up to 3000sqft, this appliance also allows you to connect at least 25 devices, at once. Moreover, the Tri-Band functionality is also a handy resource for the 4K streamers, allowing them to deploy the additional bandwidth and speeds that reach up to 5400mbps.</p>



<p>From a structural point of view, this appliance resembles a drone with 8 antennas adding to the routing capabilities of the same. When it comes to the internals, there is a dual-core processor at the helm. What stands out though is the built-in Max-Stream extender that ensures unmatched throughput and minimal signal drops.</p>



<p>However, it is the availability of 8 Gigabit ports that steals the show courtesy of the 10x faster, wired connections via every single slot. In addition to that, this powerful router also supports the MU-MIMO technology that is the primary concept behind simultaneous connections.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Ultra-fast dual-core chipset</li><li>Tri-band support with speeds reaching up to 5.4gbps</li><li>8 Gigabit Ethernet ports</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Lacks the requisite levels of user-friendliness</li></ul>

<p>For budget-centric 4K streamers, the Nighthawk R7000 from Netgear is the best possible selection. While there aren’t many performance tradeoffs when it comes to making it more affordable as compared to some of the other products on our list, it comes with a slightly underpowered dual-core processor that isn’t as equipped as the one in the Nighthawk R9000.</p>



<p>However, the standout attributes include the extensive wireless coverage of up to 1800sqft followed by a cumulative speed that can go up to 1900mbps. Despite being a dual-band router, the processing throughput is at par with the tri-band contemporaries. This router is capable of connecting 30 devices at once while ensuring the best band allotment for the concerned gadgets, depending on the distance.</p>



<p>When it comes to the best set of features, this affordable router from Netgear comes equipped with four gig Ethernet ports for faster, wired connections. Apart from that, Netgear ensures a seamless app-based setup followed by the inclusion of parental control and the class-leading Armor support for keeping network-specific threats at bay.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Excellent Beamforming+ capabilities</li><li>ReadySHARE setup for data backup</li><li>Exceptional security standards</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Each one of the three routers is equipped with class-leading wireless technologies that make room for faster and lag-free 4K streaming. However, the final selection depends on your budget and personal or professional preferences. For instance, if you are seeking the highest possible speeds, responsive UI, VR readiness, and a brand-centric validation, the Netgear Nighthawk R9000 is the one to consider.</p>



<p>Then again, if your secondary requirement is diversified wired connectivity, the Linksys Max-Stream is the best wireless router for streaming 4K. Lastly, for the budget users who aren’t exactly upbeat about tri-band technologies, the Nighthawk R7000 from Netgear is the perfect buying option.</p>
