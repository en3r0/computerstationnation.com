<p>We start our discussion with a feature-packed set, best suited for smaller office spaces and a restricted workforce. This executive office furniture set from Bestar boasts of excellent manufacturing materials, including the commercial-grade laminate and high-density P2 board. The melamine finish further adds to the aesthetic credibility of this office suite.</p>



<p>The structural brilliance continues with the 1-inch thick working surface and the brushed handles carved out of nickel. When it comes to storage, this is one of the few executive office furniture suites to stack in a utility drawer, hutch, multiple shelves, file cabinet, and a dedicated bookcase. The workplace where you accommodate the monitor also features a sliding channel for the keyboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this product excels in the cable management department courtesy of the intuitive grommet bridge which is reversible in nature. Moreover, you can also choose the U-shaped variant of this furniture set to accommodate an additional professional into the mix. Besides offering a workstation that is stain-proof, immune to wear and tear, and scratch-resistant, the company sweetens the pot further with an ergonomic chair. The height-adjustable sitting option also features sturdy armrests and innovative lumbar support.</p>

<p>If you are interested in modern executive office furniture or rather a suite for accommodating several professionals at once, this U-Shaped set from Bush Business certainly fits the bill. This product flaunts thermally infused work surfaces and laminates. The working area or the desk top is therefore resistant to scratches and occasional stains. Moreover, the structure is extremely durable with every element featuring a 1-inch thickness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a more creative yet professional setup, the cubicle furniture set from Bush Business is the perfect contender. While the Hansen cherry finishing improves the aesthetic credibility of the element, it is the excellent quality of the laminate that steals the show. To start with, the device flaunts several structural innovations, including steel, fabric, and wood as the manufacturing inclusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides that, every cubicle flaunts a dedicated hutch, featuring tack board and back panels with proper finishing. The best thing about this luxury executive office furniture set is that it translates to a corner desk with a maximum working space of almost 48 inches. The company also allows you to pair accessory task lights with the product.</p>



<p>Some of the more standout attributes include the availability of self-closing storage units and hinges clubbed with the availability of other storage units and smaller cabinets. This product brings forth two shelves that are fixed and four adjustable units, making way for concealed storage support. Last but not least, the cubicle office set also comes with decent cable management support.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Extremely durable with scratch-proof laminate</li><li>Inclusion of six storage shelves; two fixed and four adjustable</li><li>Self-closing, innovative hinges add to the productivity of this furniture set</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The installation process is extremely time-consuming&nbsp;</li><li>Doesn’t support standalone usage</li></ul>

<p>Editors’ Rating- 4.5 out of 5</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>While these are some of the best executive office furniture suites in the market, you must ascertain the requirements before making the purchase. Despite each product having its utility, we would personally recommend the L-shaped or U-Shaped suite from Bush furniture, provided you are looking to set up an expansive corporate establishment.</p>



<p>For better demarcation, the cubicle series is the best possible choice. However, if you are only looking for a compact space with an ergonomic chair and dedicated storage units, the standalone and affordable product from Bestar is the one to go with.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t like any of these three options, feel free to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=computersta08-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=19641f20736026d150518dbf1f9f95a4&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Executive Office Furniture Set">continue browsing</a> over on Amazon.</p>

<p>Here is a solid wood computer armoire that features several additional structural elements like a dedicated hutch, a separate cabinet for the CPU, and even a keyboard-storing shelf. However, the aesthetics associated with this product are different as compared to a basic computer desk with doors. On this innovative product from SELVA, we get open-ended panel doors with an armoire frame to rely on.</p>



<p>Other essential specs include the storage cubby for the CPU and the pull-out shelf for keyboards and additional documents. What stands out is the inclusion of three adjustable yet open shelves, capable of accommodating printers and other home essentials. This product works as a convenient workspace and frees up a lot of home and office space. However, you can always close the doors once the work is over and the products, in its entirety, looks like a towering, 52” cabinet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The manufacturing quality, involving engineering, water-resistant wood further adds to the credibility of this intuitive computer desk with doors. Besides that, there are soft yet durable hinges with metallic undertones which make door closing easier as compared to other desks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This computer armoire desk from SELVA has an overwhelming presence but it looks quite aesthetic, provided you are considering this as your home workstation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Featured printer shelf and CPU cubby</li><li>Inclusion of three sizeable shelves that are height adjustable</li><li>Sturdy frame with good-looking panel doors</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Humongous structure</li><li>Wide Armoire desk that takes up enough space</li></ul>

<p>This product features on our list purely on the basis of the aesthetics and antiqued finishing elements. Although you can use this as a corner armoire computer desk, it primarily comes across as a solid wooden structure with multiple structural elements. When it comes to manufacturing quality, this product flaunts high-quality engineered wood, clubbed with paint finish and sturdy yet soft hinges with metallic underlining.</p>



<p>In terms of structural components, the Sauder Harbor computer armoire desk provides a space-saving section at the top which acts like a hutch and accommodates select decorative elements. The majority of the desk body features open cabinets for storing keyboard, printers, CPU, and whatnot. The expansive storage unit for the monitor is adequate enough for basic to advanced professional requirements.</p>



<p>The slide-out sections make way for a versatile storage unit. However, the entire workstation can be encapsulated courtesy of the louvered door panels. When closed, the product looks like a 68” cabinet with a 10” inch open hutch at the top. The best thing about this computer armoire is that it has multiple sub-sections within the 68-inch structure, capable of freeing up a lot of home and office space.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Proper segregation of shelves, slide-out sections, and storage panels&nbsp;</li><li>10-inch open hutch at the top with aesthetic significance</li><li>Bottom-down adjustable shelves for accommodating a massive amount of office supplies</li></ul>

<p>There are several versions of computer armoire desks that are currently retailing online. However, we have listed three of the most usable options, based on their functional nature and enviable versatility.</p>



<p>The final selection, however, is at your discretion. For instance, if you are looking for a computer armoire with louvered panel and doors, you can opt for the ones featured by SELVA and Sauder.

<p>Gaming is timeless. Whether you are battling it out in the vintage &#8216;Street Fighter&#8217; series or navigating your way through the modern &#8216;Fortnight Battle Royale,&#8217; playing video games is an unmatched feeling and experience. Maybe you are an impulsive teenager enjoying your summer vacations or a 30-something-year-old reminiscing about the younger, better days, either way video games are just good fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaming also presents a host of advantages. Apart from enhancing memory and coordination, it also improves your attention span and quickens your brain. Additionally, playing online with people from all across the globe, with different backgrounds, ethnicities, and beliefs, eliminates discrimination, and instills the values of love, brotherhood, and equality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a gamer, you are always looking for ways to maximize your experience. There are several factors that you might want to consider, such as the room size, speaker strength, game-reclining chair, TV/projector, and gaming TV stand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we present several ideas about setting up your game room.</p>



<h2>Less is more</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/g1x6g1/completely_reasonable_apartment_setup/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">completely reasonable apartment setup</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>You do not always need to dedicate an entire room to your gaming activities. Reddit user, <em>Wuvica</em>, shows how you can effectively utilize a limited amount of space to set up a desirable gaming system.</p>







<h2>On the go</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/7htiap/im_a_truck_driver_with_a_pc_and_a_dream/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I&#8217;m a truck driver with a pc and a dream</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>What is better than having your gaming setup? Having your gaming setup in your vehicle. With a truck set up with a computer gaming system, Reddit user, <em>BudgieBeater</em>, is living the ultimate dream of every gamer.</p>



<h2>A battlestation in a van</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/cetna0/i_live_in_a_van_and_this_is_my_battle_station/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I live in a van and this is my battle station!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Another gaming system set up inside a vehicle. If the idea of living in a van and waking up to a new scene every day is not tempting enough, add to it the pleasure of having your favorite video games at your disposal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Peaceful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/bx4csz/i_call_itserenity/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I call it&#8230;Serenity</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This setup by Reddit user <em>thedesigner2011</em> is all kinds of serene. The monitors used are Samsung CRG9 and Acer X34, while the IKBC MF87 keyboard and the Ascend Acoustics Sierra 2 speakers just add to the overall fun and experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Cool and creative</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/88mrjw/the_gum_ball_pc_tried_to_be_different_and_fun_on/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">The Gum Ball PC. Tried to be different and fun on this build.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This is one of the most unique setups on this entire list. With multiple monitors, a gaming keyboard, and a gumball to go with, this buildup will earn applause from any dedicated gamer.</p>



<h2>Less is more</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/7y1byy/can_i_join_your_ranks/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Can I join your ranks?</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As a gamer, a private space that optimizes your focus is everything. This gaming setup by <em>Daxiongmao87 </em>shows that a genuine gamer can set up an effective gaming setup within a space that might be perhaps nonexistent to ordinary people.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bedroom setup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/cb07be/my_setup_is_finally_finished_after_3_years_of/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My setup is finally finished after 3 years of part time job savings!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A rack full of video games, a desk lined up with a sophisticated gaming setup, a cozy-looking bed, and a TV being used as a wallpaper, is all kinds of fresh and classy. Getting your monitor to swivel towards the bed will allow you to enjoy TV shows and movies as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Combine gaming with music</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/85ikwj/my_music_gaming_room/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My Music / Gaming Room</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This setup, belonging to Reddit user <em>Bokemoke</em>, is a dream for people who love gaming as much as they love music. To achieve the desired effect, throw in vibrant, blue lighting into the mix.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Battlestation with a view</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/b1s9fi/update_my_brooklyn_battlestation/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Update: My Brooklyn Battlestation</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It is a lie that gamers, once in front of their gaming setups, do not care about the outside world. This setup from an apartment in Brooklyn shows that a beautiful view overlooking a gaming system just adds to the overall beauty and fun.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bed away</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/8pkdt1/confined_to_bed_after_surgury_built_this_in/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Confined to bed after surgury &#8211; built this in anticipation</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>If you are one of those gamers who enjoy their games like they enjoy their games &#8211; in bed &#8211; this one&#8217;s for you. Additionally, such a setup is also beneficial for bedridden people due to an injury or a disease and need something to pass the time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Minimal but elegant</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/ecsn1u/my_minimal_setup/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My minimal setup</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Again, you do not need infinitely deep pockets to set your dream battlestation up. This setup, consisting of a whitewashed wall, a few aesthetic paintings, and a gaming computer, shows how to make the optimum use of limited resources.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Simplicity is graceful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/f1mdto/hows_my_set_up_everyone/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">How&#8217;s my set up everyone?</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Not everyone enjoys playing video games in a funkily-lighted, fancy looking game room. Sometimes, you just need a bit of calm and ease to maximize your gaming performance (especially if you are a dog).</p>



<h2>A gaming fort</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/e7cghq/the_den/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">The Den</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A gamer does not ask for anything more than a tiny, secluded world of his own, where he can stuff all his gaming equipment, sit back and enjoy the ride. This gaming den constructed by Reddit user <em>UncleViper</em> comes pretty close to such a world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Neat and pretty</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/fz468j/simple_and_clean/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Simple and clean</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Who says that gamers are messy and disorganized? This battle station, set up by Reddit user <em>superstrm</em>, is the very definition of organized. With white-colored walls, a spotlessly clean table, and sophisticated wall-hangings, someone might easily mistake this gaming setup as an office in an organization.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Maximum experience</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/8bqfoa/screen_real_estate/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Screen Real Estate</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With a monitor that is 49.4 inches wide, this setup brings you as close to a lifelike gaming experience as you can get. Additionally, the roller skate wheels on the chair allow it to glide effortlessly across all kinds of surfaces.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Stands out</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/f9c2i6/my_wallet_and_i_are_not_talking/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My wallet and I are not talking</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With a massive HD monitor, some of the top gaming equipment, and 3D wall panels designed by Art3D, this gaming setup might cost you a few bucks but will be worth every penny.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why play in one place?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/g6nvll/living_in_a_van_doesnt_mean_you_cant_have_a_nice/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Living in a van doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t have a nice battlestation.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Yet another battle station set up in a van &#8211; well, what can we say; we are absolutely in love with the idea. Living in a van does require some vast sacrifices, but it is worth it, especially when you can be in proximity to your ideal gaming system.</p>



<h2>A sunset to die for (in a game, of course)</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/fxi3zr/admiring_the_sunset_while_working_from_home/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Admiring the sunset while working from home</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Just ignore those long lines of code on the monitors&#8217; screens, and check out the gorgeous sunset in the background. Now, imagine yourself tearing the opponents apart on that massive monitor screen, with such a stunning natural backdrop. Do we need to say more?</p>



<h2>A battle in the forests</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/fw5nlj/2020_setup/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">2020 Setup🍃🌿</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This gaming setup has been installed in a friendly, secluded outhouse in the Pacific Northwest. Surrounded by greenery and nature, the natural breeze entering the room will allow you to remain energized and focused for as long as you play.</p>



<h2>Benefitting from the basement</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/g5vcn4/who_else_had_to_utilize_their_unfinished_basement/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Who else had to utilize their unfinished basement into their work from home office? I&#8217;m trying to take full advantage.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Unused basements are a goldmine for gamers looking to set up a full-fledged gaming room &#8211; you have space and the required privacy. Reddit user <em>fortierj</em> is utilizing his basement as his home workspace, but it is not difficult to see how it can be used as an ideal gaming setup as well.</p>



<h2>Gold</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/6jieb8/pretty_happy_with_how_this_turned_out/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Pretty happy with how this turned out</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The color combination in this room is absolutely stunning &#8211; everything matches beautifully, even down to the painting on the wall and the rug decorating the floor. As a gamer, you understand the importance of synchronization, and therefore, of this room.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Soothing</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/avplup/my_minimal_battlestation/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My minimal battlestation</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The color white has a beauty that is unmatched by any other color. This minimalist gaming setup, complemented by white-colored walls and a spotless desk, has a peaceful aura about it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Black beauty</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/avplup/my_minimal_battlestation/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My minimal battlestation</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Taking a 180-degree turn from white, let us now focus on this classy, full-black gaming setup. The monitor used is Samsung 49&#8243; CHG90 Gaming Monitor, while the keyboard is the HyperX Alloy Elite RGB.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Messy? Think again</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/8mye1m/some_would_call_it_messy_but_i_love_it/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Some would call it messy, but I love it.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>At first glance, this gaming setup might appear messy and cluttered. However, only a closer inspection will reveal the amount of effort, time, dedication, and concentration it must have required to achieve this degree of organization and precision—anything but messy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Keep it simple</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/8049ns/retro_mood/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Retro Mood</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Another one of those setups which do not require anything fancy, but get the job done. The stand-out feature of this neat little gaming setup is the panel of colorful lights on the wall.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A view-tiful gaming setup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/axeb5e/i_thought_the_sunset_looked_nice_today_new_build/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I thought the sunset looked nice today, new build, changes to come!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Another setup on our list with a brilliant background view. This gaming buildup is from a house in Washington D.C and makes use of some highly sophisticated computer equipment and a comfortable reclining chair.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

</div></figure>



<p>This setup allows you to keep in touch with the outside world through the vivid views that it offers. However, if, at times, you feel uncomfortable with people staring at you, you can always shut the half-transparent blinds. Particularly useful for people who like standing up and moving around when they are feeling restless while working.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>7. Funky</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>A very clean and functional setup, using a USB-C dock velcroed to the bottom of the desk to connect the multiple monitors. A beneficial structure if you are someone who enjoys working without too much light coming in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>9. One-cable setup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Another kind of setup for people who wish to work without too much light seeping into the room. With the light coming from an electric candle and through the shades, this setup will make sure that you still have enough light to keep you working without hurting your eyes or head.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>10. Working from home is fun</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gwdcxt/working_from_home_here_isnt_half_bad/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Working from home here isn&#8217;t half bad</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>&nbsp;A setup which is ideal for people who work with music and musical instruments. The desk is the IKEA Barkaboda kitchen countertop, on autonomous standing legs. The guitar is from Gibson, while the speakers are Yamaha HS8, connected to a Soundrise pro monitor.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>11. Unfancy but effective</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gzex1g/changed_up_my_workplace_a_bit_during_covid_boredom/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Changed up my workplace a bit during covid boredom.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>If you want to give your home workspace a bit of shakeup without spending too much time or money, this is one of the best ideas for you. Cleaning up your table and getting a new keyboard or a tiny table clock can go a long way in restructuring and improving your mood and attitude.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>12. Clean is not for everyone</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gyttk8/my_finally_organized_study_space_im_a_visual/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My finally organized study space&#8211; I&#8217;m a visual person that likes to be able to see everything in its place.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Even though there are numerous people who prefer their home workspace neat and organized. However, others feel that being surrounded by work papers and other materials stimulates their productivity. This home office setup is a homage to the latter kind of workers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>13. Healthy working</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gyopsn/starting_to_come_together_just_waiting_on_a/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">starting to come together, just waiting on a back-ordered uplift desk and vertical laptop stands.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It is extremely important that, while working those long hours, you take care of your health and body. The huge LED monitor ensures that you do not damage your eyes by concentrating too hard, while the Steelcase Gesture chair allows you to keep a relaxed posture that your back will thank you for.</p>



<h2>14. Keep it simple</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gxtp9g/old_and_new/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Old and new</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This setup is another example of how you do not need to do anything fancy to get a working space which is effective yet aesthetic. A Hague Blue wall color by Farrow and Ball, an ‘Everything is fine’ art piece, and a spotlessly clean floor, come together to create an enviable home working area.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>15. A shelf that makes a statement</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gx2j11/new_office_view/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">New office view!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With a desk that houses all your essential work equipment &#8211; including a laptop, printer, and telephone &#8211; and a shelf that portrays your favorite photographs and other family memorabilia, this setup is an ideal combination of work plus sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>16. Combining work and play</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gurpd0/my_workspace_in_toulouse_france_closeups_in_first/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My Workspace in Toulouse, France. (Close-ups in first comment)</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Constant work can get boring and exhausting; it is just normal that you require a bit of break in between. If you want to enjoy your periodic breaks without having to leave the room, this setup from a house in Toulouse shows you exactly how to &#8211; by setting up your work desk and telly in the same room, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>17. Working musically</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gu06fl/finally_sorted_out_my_room_got_rid_of_34_of_the/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Finally sorted out my room, got rid of 3/4 of the shelving, hung my guitars up, and PLANTS</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Every professional musician’s fantasy involves a nice, quiet spot to work, with a wall that holds all his precious musical instruments &#8211; this setup provides exactly that. A nice quiet cup of tea and a soothing desktop wallpaper (Quiet, by Dennis Istomin in this case) obviously help wake your creative beast up.</p>



<h2>18. Nature is the best catalyst to productivity</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gti2vy/saturday_sun/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Saturday Sun</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>What better place to get work done, than in front of a window that allows you to peek right into the very heart of nature? Throw in a few indoor plants as well, to enhance the vibe and maximize the benefits of working in a natural environment.</p>



<h2>19. The color of Earth</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gt61zh/where_i_spend_too_much_time_these_days/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Where I spend too much time these days</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The Earth-colored walls and table give this home workplace a natural feel. Add to it the inspiring Humpback Whale poster, and you have a workplace that is silent, yet has an invigorating energy all around it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>20. Serenity</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gs8rcz/can_i_work_from_home_forever/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Can I work from home forever?</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>IT workers often prefer a nice, quiet space for working. So, it is no surprise that for many such workers, a work-from-home setup is a welcome one. This setup gives you a secluded spot to get your job done, while ensuring that you stay in touch with nature and the outside world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>21. Classy and timeless</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Even though this conventional looking setup is from an actual office, such a workplace can be easily set up at home. All you need is a quiet room and a decent-sized desk to place all your work-related equipment, and you have a home office setup that is no less than the one you just left behind at the office.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>22. Peaceful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gs8n2p/the_best_way_to_deal_with_work_from_home/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">The best way to deal with work from home</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

Reddit user <em>liI-xaniel</em> has provided a solution which is cheap and effective. Just choose any corner of your house, put up a desk, place your things, and fire away without any distractions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>23. Less is more</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gs48xo/still_waiting_on_the_new_computer_but_the_rest_is/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Still waiting on the new computer but the rest is ready to go!!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This brilliant setup by Reddit user <em>blairnet</em>, shows us how to make the most of a not-very-large space. The user has managed to accommodate a full-blown work setup, effectively, in one corner of a medium sized room, without making it seem congested or uncomfortable to work in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>24. Basements are useful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/grr1ll/finally_got_the_basement_workplace_finished/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Finally got the basement workplace finished #Secretlab</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>House owners often consider basements a place where all the house junk, never to be used, is stashed away. However, this setup shows us how, with the right kind of effort and motivation, a basement can be transformed into a stunning and smart workplace. After all, the fact that nobody ever enters the basement, makes it the perfect spot to get your work done without being disturbed.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>25. Another minimalist design</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/grub3p/improving_on_the_workspace_bit_by_bit/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Improving on the workspace bit by bit</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Yet another example of how you do not need an entire room to set up an effective home working space. A desktop, holding your computers and other important items, along with a wall carrying some stunning art, is more than a good enough workplace.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>26. Nice and cozy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/gvsia8/i_prefer_the_cozy_look/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I prefer the cozy look.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>If you are working from home, you need to feel like you are at home &#8211; relaxed. This room provides you with a working space while keeping you at ease. When exhausted, you can lie down on the sofa; when looking for a break, you can step out on the balcony with a hot cup of coffee; when wanting to relax your tired eyes out, you can always stare at the colorful plants spread throughout the room.</p>



<h2>27. Blue is brilliant</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/gvmn1f/almost_completed_battlestation/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Almost completed battlestation&#8230;</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A blue light always paints a dreamy look on everything &#8211; and even a home workplace looks enticing with it.</p>

<p>This product is the perfect rendition of mid-century furniture, featuring a sturdy and premium wooden chassis. While the structural components are pretty minimalistic, this desk can be used to accommodate computers and other electronic devices. Using the same for reading and occasional writing is also possible. Not just that, the faux wooden overlay further amplifies the structural significance of this mid-century computer desk.</p>



<p>This desk comes with a 40-inch working space which is quite adequate for basic computing chores. The most striking feature associated with this desk is the large drawer, structured right in the middle. The drawer doesn’t have segregations which make it possible to store keyboards, documents, and chargers, as per requirements. Most importantly, you do not require additional expertise to install the furniture as the company provides a pretty standard manual.</p>



<p>Here is a mid-century desk from Christopher Knight Home that doesn’t need to add in a lot of secondary features. The layout and design elements adhere to the mid-century aesthetics and the cleaner yet contemporary attributes can complement any interior. Most importantly, the base material used in manufacturing is rubberwood which makes it light and perfect for smaller spaces.</p>

<p>Mid-century ladder desks are underrated but extremely useful. While you wouldn’t find many ladder desks in offices, they are aesthetically brilliant and capable of saving a lot of horizontal space, in the case room dimensions are constrained. This product from GOTDCO offers a decent storage space and a spacious working surface that features the solidarity of MDF. Most importantly, this product is perfectly suitable for users who prefer rounded edges and corners.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Mid-century computer desks can be different compared to the conventional ones. Most importantly, it is important to keep your expectations realistic while selecting mid-century furniture. Based on the aforementioned list, you can opt for the basic mid-century desk from Christopher Knight Home if minimalism is what you are looking for.</p>



<p>However, the second product from Ameriwood is probably the most appropriate as it offers innovative and productive structural elements like a drawer and cubby followed by an affordable price tag.
