<p>You may wish to keep your Graphics card away for a few days, months, or years. The reason for storing the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> graphics card can be founded on several reasons, but regardless, you want to have the card in the best form possible when you need it again and fit for purposes it is supposed to perform.</p>



<p>How you store this card, will determine if you will end up using it again, after keeping it away for a few years or months and even days. Someone suggested that if fridges could store drinks and foods for a long while, and owning to the cool environment, it would be great for storing a graphics card.</p>



<p>While new and improved cards are coming through and hitting our screens with all the intensity in the world, the truth is that there will still be things your old card will be notable for, and this is why you must store it properly.</p>







<h2>Here are a few ways to achieve this result:</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Use an anti-static bag or box</strong></h3>



<p>There is no better place to start this list than here, this beautiful mention. The goal of storing your Graphics card is to keep it for use later and this is one that you equally agree to, to achieve this goal; your card must be kept away from static electricity.</p>



<p>Static electricity will destroy your card then save it. Keeping the card away from the rays and damaging effect of static electricity is your best bite, and you eat this bite with your eyes closed.</p>



<p>Similarly, ensure there is no space in the bag or box, if there is any, pad the space with paper. Make sure the card is perfectly padded, to save it away from the usual effects of fall and knocks that may damage the card and affect its functionality.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Cardboard box</strong></h3>



<p>Card boxes are great and an excellent way to store your graphics card when not in use, but this option must be given attention. Just like the anti-static bag or box, it must be observed that there should be no free space in the box, this way your card does not get affected by movement, and knocks.</p>



<p>Also, a cardboard box provides amazing protection from static electricity and this is everything you are trying to avoid. With static electricity of the way, you are two times ahead of your game and in perfect shape to have the card available for use again.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Plastic box</strong></h3>



<p>Here is another great way to protect and save your card for the future and the next time you may want to use your graphics card again, the plastic box provides perfect protection from static electricity, this of course is our most important feature to look out for.</p>



<p>It is also waterproof, so you do not have to fear where and how the box is placed. You are guaranteed protection from the most important aspect, static electricity.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Original box</strong></h3>



<p>Your graphics card always comes in a custom size box, packed to give the card the best protection and it is made fit for purpose. So if you intend to keep your card away for a little way? Getting it back into the box will be a great way to go, and this will guarantee amazing protection.</p>



<p>There are downsides and we know it, you might have lost the box. Moreover, just like the many, you may have damaged it out of that first-time experience and excitement or it has been damaged by water or even confiscated. You can try out the other options on the list to balance it up.</p>



<h3>5.<strong>Get a carrying case</strong></h3>



<p>A safe is it, and this will give you long-term protection if you have the singular intention of keeping the card away for a usually long time. </p>



<p>A carrying case will be the best option on this list, it offers the best protection. It is waterproof, a fantastic addition and on top of this, it is shockproof.</p>



<p>Yes, a carrying case or safe as you will have it are expensive, but for the sake of the greater good which is the security they provide, risking a few bills to get the best solution in the market won’t be a big ask.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Just as it is important to keep your Graphics card away from static electricity, it must be guided from water damage. If you do not achieve this two essential purpose, it is safe to say that you should forget everything about the card. As the purpose of storing it will be defeated.</p>



<p>Keeping your graphics card safe and in the best condition is a goal that you must hold onto if you are to experience the best results with your storage goals. In addition to selecting any one option on this list, ensure to keep the card in a dry room and at the best temperature.</p>

<p>There are many ways a good day can go sour and make you feel down for the long hours, your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> graphics card fan, not spinning can be the piece that makes that twist and redirect your trajectory.</p>



<p>So what happens when your graphics card fan is not spinning? Your GPU temperature is running at a risk and when it heats so much, you know what will happen next. It blows up or it stops functioning, and when any one of these two things happens, your day can go the wrong way.</p>



<p>These and more are a couple of reasons that you must keep your graphics card functioning at its best, it&#8217;s very best. Besides, if for any reason your graphics card fan is not working, it is not a reason to worry so much as you have the best solutions in this article.</p>







<h2><strong>Here are a few solutions to the problem of your graphics card fan not spinning:</strong></h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Check if the computer is in an idle state:</strong></h3>



<p>Technology has done a massive great for us, and it regulates how things work and if your graphics card fan is not working. &nbsp;Worrying, at first sight, might not be necessary. Your card fan might not be spinning, because it is in an idle state. This is the case, with technology-inspired programs.</p>



<p>Inbuilt features are placed in graphics cards today, which make them, relax when you are not performing high-end graphics or intensive CPU operations. </p>



<p>During this time, the computer will instead use other cooling options, like the heat sink. This is the case when you are performing programs like web browsing.</p>



<p>The graphics card fan is programmed in this case to come alive once the temperature clocks a certain threshold, you will not need to do anything to make it come alive. It will automatically click when the conditions are met.</p>



<p>So check this out first before trying out other options.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Restart the computer</strong></h3>



<p>Just the same way, you feel fresh and relaxed after having a good nap or a cold bath after a long day of work. </p>



<p>Restarting your computer gives it the same kind of balance and sets you aside for smooth operations, and functions. This is the case, for almost all kinds of malfunctioning we have seen with the computer.</p>



<p>It is simple, but often the best option to fix your computer issues. Refresh it and you are a mile away from the trouble of your Graphics card fan not spinning. Give it a simple refresh and see how it turns up, if it does not work still, then you are left with a handful of other options to go with.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Check the connections;</strong></h3>



<p>For smooth operations, your GPU will need power and just enough of it to function at its best.</p>



<p>Sometimes the reason for your card that is not spinning can be a connection that is not perfect or one that was perfect before but has overlapped. It is easy for your computer wires to leave their socket and this can be the case here.</p>



<p>Ensure that your 8 or 6 pins cable is perfectly connected, to guarantee the best results with your graphics card. The issue can be your connections, so get this checked and ensure all of your connections are in shape. If the problem persists then the next option might help.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Oil it</strong></h3>



<p>Fan bearings just like your car engine will need some greasing occasionally and this is what you do when you experience issues with your graphics card when it won’t just spin. Add in a little oil and you are good to go, this is one guaranteed way that has shown tremendous results.</p>



<p>So get the fans oiled and you can be sure to have the bliss you require on your graphics compartment.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Clean the fans of dust and debris</strong></h3>



<p>Debris in the CPU has a way of coming to rest in your GPU and of course; where else other than your graphics fan, will they find the comfort they seek?</p>



<p>This is the problem with the graphics card fan, when debris gets here and is stocked, your fan will not spin.</p>



<p>A thorough cleaning will make the difference and set you apart, on a great journey. Getting compressed air will be, as the magic powder that clears dirt’s and this will surely get your fan spinning again.</p>



<h3>5. <strong>Check the divers</strong></h3>



<p>Rightly, so, the drivers might be the one thing that is hindering the full functionality of your Graphics card fans. Check for the drivers, troubleshoot them if you can, and update them if they require it.</p>



<h3>6.<strong> Replace the fan</strong></h3>



<p>There is always one option that will not fail, so if you have tried all six options already, trying this last option will be a great delight and the perfect way to go.</p>



<p>For mechanical failures, replacing the fan is the best way to achieve the results that you require. Also, you know what comes with starting afresh. It a completely new beginning and this can be sublime.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>You will require the right cooling systems in place to achieve the finest results with your graphics-intensive tasks, like using CAD or programming on your computer.</p>



<p>And running video editing software, will all rest on the computer&#8217;s graphics power and when your graphics card fan, is not working this can be a problem.</p>



<p>Similarly, the graphics card often helps to reduce the heavy burden placed on the CPU. When the graphics card heats up, achieving this task will be a difficult thing to do and a height that might not be attained.</p>



<p>The graphics card plays a seasoned role in the overall functionality of your computer and getting it working at its best offering is a blessing, there are a couple of reasons why the card will fail to work at its best, and highlighted above are proven solutions to get this problem, under check.</p>

<p>Upgrades are essentials and should be part of every computer package that is thrown our way. To achieve the best performance on your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> you will need to optimize the computer to reach its highest limits.</p>



<p>We are not advising that you push your computer to the brinks, you can, however, upgrade to some extent.Besides, for computers, just like every other aspect of electronics, upgrades will see them running at their best and with improved performance. If your video rendering and 3D animation run slowly, the sign on the wall is that your computer needs some upgrading.</p>



<p>While upgrading is great, it is cost-effective and this is where Overclocking is your best bite. Overclocking is a way of stretching your computer&#8217;s powers, to reach its highest height. Moreover, this is in no way, the same as upgrading the computer, even though they perform an identical function.</p>







<h2><strong>What is Overclocking</strong>?</h2>



<p>This may have to ring a bell, and probably this is not the first time you are hearing it. We will love to define it by way of describing it than giving it a clear-cut meaning. </p>



<p>Computers come with what is called a clock speed, and the manufacturer usually sets this, it is the same as your car that comes with some Horsepower.</p>



<p>Just the same way you can tone your car engine to reach new heights, you can increase the clock speed of the computer to meet new standards. This clock speed is usually the core clock, but also understand that not all computers can be overclocked.</p>



<p>The higher you overclock the computer, the more performance you get. Also, if you are into graphics rendering and modeling you are sure of having improved performance in this regard as well.</p>



<p>With your games run smoothly and leaving you on the tail end of a brand new experience, so here are a few ways to achieve this result.</p>



<h3>1.<strong>Get an Overclocking tool</strong></h3>



<p>MSI Afterburner is a proven tool in this area and it serves the purpose with more than enough clarity, but they are more and better Overclocking tools you can use for this same function and achieve the same result.</p>



<p>Also, if you are one of those unique people that love trying and spicing things up, you can experiment with various other tools cut out for this purpose. The most important thing is the result it produces.</p>



<p>So here is the thing, it is like going to war. You will need your ammunition and other things, which will set you apart and make you, win at war. The Overclocking tool is the first way to start this war and win at it.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Conduct a benchmark stress test</strong></h3>



<p>You have your Overclocking tool in place, the next thing of interest is the benchmarking tool. This can be the same tool like the one you will be use for benchmarking or a different one altogether. Irrespective of the case, a benchmarking tool is important for several reasons.</p>



<p>It gives you a perfect balance of your current computer settings and this will help you to get a perfect point to balance things up, just in case your Overclocking gets off the mark.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Benchmark your current computer settings</strong></h3>



<p>You have the benchmarking tool, preferably MSI Afterburner or any other tool of choice you are using, the next thing is to benchmark your computer.</p>



<p>If you are using the MSI Afterburner, all you have to do is to launch the software and on the main dashboard, you will see your current computer’s clock speed, memory, and temperature.</p>



<p>Ensure you do not embark on the operation if your computer temperature is above 90°, this is not ideal and will not offer you the right solutions. If you are using either of 3DMark or Furmark, the process is self-same as that of MSI AFTERBURNER.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Overclock the GPU</strong></h3>



<p>The computer had been benchmarked and by now everything is in place, your Overclocking tool is perfectly running and the temperature is great. The next thing is to overclock the GPU; some will want to do this at a go, maximum Overclocking.</p>



<p>The best thing here is to start slowing and test run, you can overclock by 5% and check to see if it affects the system performance or not, and if everything is perfect, you can increase it to 10%, the goal however is to ensure you have all your T’s crossed and your I’s dotted.</p>



<h3>5. <strong>Overclock the memory</strong></h3>



<p>The computer&#8217;s memory is as important as the GPU, and with the GPU overclocked, you can still end up with the same issues on your computer, that is the slow gameplay and others that have prompted the Overclocking.</p>



<p>To have a balance, overclock the memory too. This will put everything in shape and help you perform at your best, but just like the Graphics card, ensure you take it easy. Go at 10% for the first start and increase same, with time.</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Fine Tune</strong></h3>



<p>You have done the job right. The next thing in line is to fine-tune and see just how perfect it clicks and if you did a beautiful job with everything, you have thrown into it. Begin by running a few games and see for yourself the level of improvements done with the Overclocking.</p>



<p>If you are desirous of adding a few more speeds, then go for it and come back to fine-tune. If on the other hand, you experience lags, ensure to recheck the Overclocking and reduce the clocking by some percentage.</p>



<p>Play the games at higher resolutions, after all, this is everything you wanted to do and this is what has prompted the Overclocking in the first place. Try this and see if it is perfect.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Overclocking is a great way to arrive at the best results with your computer, while doing this all-important task, ensure you don’t overheat your computer. The goal is to improve the functionality of the computer, and not to break it down.</p>



<p>Do not also auto-overclock the computer, this will be counterproductive.</p>

<p>It can be annoying and this poses a difficult situation, when you have this file you want to transfer from your computer to your hard drive or from the hard drive to the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> and your hard drive doesn’t pop up.</p>



<p>This, of course, will hamper your productivity and delay you for a few minutes, sometimes for days, you can have this problem reoccurring. Many reasons can be reasonable for this issue and if not looked into properly, it is almost certain to reoccur after a while.</p>



<p>Here are a few solutions you can apply, to better the performance of your computer and to allow the easy exchange of information from your drive to your computer;</p>







<h2>Fixes That Are Recommended </h2>



<h3>1.Optimization</h3>



<p>Rightly so, optimize the computer and you can have the answers to the problem that has posed a challenge to you. Some settings are not just right, and this must have kicked your driver’s away from your system, unknown to you and so how do you fix this problem?</p>



<p>Simple, get a proven optimization software and optimize the computer. Ashampoo Win Optimize is our favorite optimization tool in this category, it offers in-depth cleaning and system optimization. You also get a diagnosis on the all-in-one intensive computer optimization spyware.</p>



<p>Start with optimization, and if the problem is not solved just yet, you need not worry we have some other great options you can try out.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Manually update your driver’s</strong></h3>



<p>The problem might be a driver that has broken down irretrievably, but it can be retrieved with a simple update. So get your hard drive recognized by the computer, by manually updating the drivers. What this implies is that the drivers can be updated in other ways, other than the manual update.</p>



<p>So for your manual update, click the Windows key + X to easily open the windows X menu and choose the device manager from the options on the window.</p>



<p>From Device manager, get to disk drive and expand it, if you find a yellow exclamation mark on the disk drive icon, it signals a driver issue and you are just on time to make that update happen.</p>



<p>The next step is to search automatically and make the update, this will surely open up your hard drive on the computer, but if the problem persists, we are in for a bigger role here.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Format your portable hard drive</strong></h3>



<p>This may be a hard one to do if you have loads of things saved up on the hard drive, but sometimes simple formatting is what you need to build that relationship between your windows 10 and then the hard drive. So risking this will not be a problem anyway.</p>



<p>How do you arrive at it? Simply follow the windows X keys and land at disk management again, when you are home here, right-click the hard drive and choose format hard drive if it shows here. </p>



<p>On achieving this feat, we believe you are good to go now, but if you are not, you need not worry we are together.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Run the hardware troubleshooter</strong></h3>



<p>Yes, you read this correctly. You might be wondering why we did not start it here since we have to troubleshoot every problem with the computer, trust me we have our reasons and we take each step with seasoned care. Therefore, we are here after all, and let&#8217;s see how this works.</p>



<p>Press the Windows key + 1, to open the Settings window, when you are here, head directly to the update and security section of the settings dialogue options. Click the Troubleshoot option from the button and follow the instructions therein, until you get your job done.</p>



<h3>5. <strong>Check the cable</strong></h3>



<p>I guess you never thought of this option, but here it is. As simple as this may look, it can be the course of the problem, which has made us try four different options before arriving at this end. Moreover, here might be the Promised Land after all.</p>



<p>It might be that your computer is not compatible with the cable your hard drive is using or the cable has stopped working and you do not know just here, here is what to do. </p>



<p>Try the cable on another system and see whether it pops up, if no, change the cable and try other cables if your answer here is a yes.</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Check the hard drive</strong></h3>



<p>Now that you have checked the cables, checking the hard drive if the problem persists, is an unavoidable conclusion and step you must take. </p>



<p>Here are a few basic things you must guarantee on the hard drive, first, ensure that the hard drive is turned on, secondly, connect it to a different port.</p>



<p>Your problem might be the port, lastly, connect the drive directly to the computer, do away with the USB hubs and get it directly connected.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Here are a few common issues of this kind that you are likely to experience when it comes to your external hard drive; </p>



<ul><li>External hard drive not showing up in disk management: it can be showing in other areas, but this one very important place, is where the external hard drive might fail to show.</li><li>You cannot access it in windows 10: you have recently upgraded to windows 10, and now your hard drive will not pop up, just the same way it has always done on your Windows 7 and 8.</li><li>Your USB Drive is not recognized; how do you work with your external hard drive when it cannot be recognized by your computer?</li></ul>



<p>These are common issues, you may encounter, and your issue may not fall into the categories mentioned above. However, the common thing here is that your external hard drive is not showing on your computer and this is the burden we seek to attend to and proffer lasting solutions to.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that we all run into issues with our hard drive now and then, utilizing any one of the options on this list will guarantee you success in your bid to get a lasting solution to the impasse of your card not showing up.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why losing your graphics card or getting it destroyed now is not the best thing for you, one of these reasons is that you will likely have difficulties in getting a replacement. </p>



<p>This is what we have seen with the bearish market on the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer </a>graphics card in 2021, the scarcity is just unbearable. Another reason is that they get costlier, ever heard the adage that &#8220;old is gold&#8221; sometimes this is what happens with the graphics card, they are programs that no new version can run better than the old one. So keep it safe, even when transporting it.</p>



<p>The fragile nature of the graphics card shows it deserves attention and much balance when you are moving it. The reason is that the card can be affected by bumps, and when you do not protect your Graphics card, you will end up damaging it and not using it for the purpose it was bought for.</p>



<p>Static electricity is one of the major nemeses of the graphics card when you are transporting or storing the card. The need to keep it safe, away from static electricity is one object that will pay the greatest reward.</p>



<p>In this article, we will teach you how to do this and with much ease, you need not worry, as we have proven methods to safely transport your card. So let&#8217;s dive into the options</p>







<h2> Proven Methods To Safely Transport Your Card</h2>

Moreover, for you that is moving your card, getting it back into the box it came with. Will save you the extra cash, to be spent on other alternative options available in the market.</p>



<p>We understand there could be instances where the box had been damaged, or just like many, you throw it away with the hope that you would not need it again. These things happen to all of us and this is why we have other options to save you the stress if you cannot find your box anymore.</p>



<h2>2.<strong>Get an anti-static bag or box</strong></h2>



<p>So the second option you can try out if you have lost the box the card came with is to get an anti-static bag or box, we are particular about the bag, it cannot be just any kind of bag. </p>



<p>It should be an anti-static bag or box, static electricity as we have earlier introduced and mentioned, causes harm to your Graphics card.You should not put the card away on the premise of keeping it safe, only to discover you contributed to the defective state of the card, especially when transporting it. </p>



<p>So ensure to keep it safe, by getting a bag that will not expose the card to static electricity, this way you will have a win-win situation.</p>



<h2>3.<strong> Use a Cardboard Box</strong></h2>



<p>A card box is your next option if you do not fancy the first two, or just want to try out other options. Moreover, why the card box you may ask? The first reason for the choice of the card box is that it shields you from static electricity, and this is everything we want to do.</p>



<p>Therefore, with a card box, you are guaranteed protection from static electricity. And your card will be in the best form of protection available in the market, and when you are transporting it. There is just one thing you must take note of when using this option.</p>



<p>Even with a card box, you can still damage your graphics card if the box is just too big and you fail to pay for the remaining space. You must leave nothing to chances, so get it padded with the paper if you find enough space in your box to ensure it does not move.</p>



<h2>4. <strong>Get a heavy-duty carrying case</strong></h2>



<p>This may be a big ask, especially for the cost of getting the carrying case but trust me this is one great option you can try out. There are many advantages with using a heavy-duty carrying case and this is not just for your graphics card alone, but for other things, you may want to transport.</p>



<p>The case is waterproof, you have a quality guarantee, that water cannot get into your safe and destroy your card. This is a major improvement, as against the other four options on the list and you cannot agree less that it is the most effective.</p>



<p>In addition to being waterproof, a carrying case is also shockproof, nothing happens to your card if the card somersaults, and yes we are not praying for this but this is just how much protection a carrying safe offers you. </p>



<p>Regardless of your budget, you can easily find a carrying safe that fits it.</p>



<h2>5. <strong>Use a plastic box</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, a plastic box. Moreover, this is one great option you can try as a seasoned way of safely transporting your graphics card. The plastic box had been used by many and it has proved effective, interesting it is waterproof, however, we cannot guarantee its shockproof content.</p>



<p>If you are trying this option we have some recommendations for you, first, ensure you use paper and cardboard to pad the card before placing it in the plastic box.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Electronic equipment and materials use electromagnetic coils as inductors or transformers. However, graphics cards, serve as inductors, and when current passes through the coils; it creates a magnetic field around it. </p>



<p>This field plays a huge role in how your card functions, and also the cause of vibration sometimes. Graphics cards require a strong current for it working, and when an unusual strong power passes through these coils, it causes the coil to vibrate, this happens usually when your graphics card is under immense load. </p>



<p>This particular problem is what is called graphics card vibration or coil whine. While there is no generally accepted single format to fix this problem, they are a couple of options you can try to arrive at the best result for your graphics card. We have highlighted these options on our list and trust me they are options you can try out, even on a budget.</p>



<p>Your connections can go wrong and this will surely affect how your graphics card works, a graphics card vibration is one of the regular defects you will experience on your computer with wrong connections on your graphics card.</p>

<p>SSD is fast becoming the mainstay of the storage unit when it comes to computers and there are a couple of questions, as to why this is happening. The power-efficient nature of the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> SSD cards is one of the major reasons for the choice of SSD storage over HDD, the SSD storage uses less power.</p>



<p>Another great reason why popular opinion has cling favorably in this light, that is the choice of SSD over HDD, is how fast they load your saved information. SSD storages provide a better and improved boot time as opposed to HDD, they interestingly boot in seconds.</p>







<h2>SSD VS HDD Power consumption</h2>



<p>A comparison of the Intel X25-M G2 which saves as the interface for the SSD cards, and Wester Digital VelociRaptor HDD. This shows that SSD consumes less power than the HDD storage option.</p>



<p>This is because, on the test, the Intel X25-M G2 uses less than half of the power consumed by the Western Digital VelociRaptor. This means that for every HDD Power usage, the SSD cards consume half of such power.</p>



<p>Interestingly, even in an idle state, HDD storage still needs to spin the discs/platters even when it is not reading or writing data. Besides, this motor responsible for the spinning rests solely on the power of the system.</p>



<p>Therefore, you are guaranteed to be consuming power on an HDD storage, even when it is idle.</p>



<p>There are a couple of reasons, that contributes to the power consumption rate of the HHD cards, the way information is stored is one of them. The HHD cards have your information saved up in a mechanical format, which makes retrieval quite hectic, this, of course, will affect the retrieval time.</p>



<p>For SSD storage, your information is saved in flash memory chips, and it retains the data stored even when there is no power, this makes a whole lot of difference and affects the power consumption rate. Similarly, data retrieval on the SSD is also seamless, and this saves you the time you spend on the computer.</p>



<p>So what does energy-efficient storage does for you? It helps you save some bills off your electricity charges and this is fantastic. As the cost of things keeps increasing, learning how to save up, can be a blessing, and one of such ways; is through your electricity billings.</p>



<p>Similarly, the energy-consuming nature of the HDD cards has its effect, and one of them is the damage it does to your battery. It zaps the battery life, with the SSD storage you are guaranteed an extended battery life, which in return will boost your productivity and keep you going.</p>



<h2>Here are a few other reasons SSD storage are preferred over HDD storage:</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Increased productivity</strong></h3>



<p>They are a couple of things a processor that is not fast and not always handy will do to your computing operations; one of such is your productivity. </p>



<p>With a greater boot time, the SSD cards offer increased productivity over the HDD storage, as you get just enough time on your hand to perform that task.</p>



<p>There is a thin line between finishing on time and being late, an SSD card will ensure you finish your task on time, and have enough extra time to party with friends. </p>



<p>Also, when it comes to gaming, SSD storage will run your apps faster than the HDD, and this is great for your overall gaming experience.</p>



<p>With extended battery life, staying atop your schedule is made possible.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Durability</strong></h3>



<p>Unlike HDD storage, the SSD storage has no moving parts and this is an ambience as you get your files stored up for good, you are also guaranteed absolute safety in the event, that your laptop fails or your computer gets shaken off. In both situations, you stay afloat!</p>



<p>The durable nature of the SSD cards makes them last longer and better than the HDD option, giving you a perfect return for your investment that you will always enjoy. Staying afloat the huddles of wear and tear is also made beautiful by the durable nature of the SSD cards.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>So what makes SSD cards so fast? This will come down to how your information is saved on the card, as opposed to HDD, SSD saves your information’s on flash chips. </p>



<p>So it is readily available on request, this is a major innovation that sets the SSD cards apart. This article has focused on the power consumption of SSD storage and HDD, drawing a line of distinction between them.</p>



<p>This is necessary, so you have the right information, on what is best for you as you build a computer that can last the time and serve its purpose. Energy efficiency is one of those things you will surely love.</p>



<p>In choosing a computer today, certain aspects of the computer must be scrutinized to confirm its workability and how suitable it is for the job you want to use it for. And in addition to these suitability features, the electricity consumption must be taken into note, to deflect the bills.</p>



<p>The SSD storage is power efficient and great when it comes to this question of what works best and how in the energy-efficient table. Settling for the SSD cards, irrespective of the price range can be a blessing in disguise, and this is for many good reasons, mentioned above.</p>

<p>Maybe you just finally took the bull by the horns, by deciding to take the smooth transition to SSD cards that have fast become the new order. One of the things you will have issues with, is your operating system, how do you move it? On the other hand, just what should you do with it?</p>



<p>There are many ways to kills this bird, and the first part which seems safe for most people is to install the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> OS new on the SSD storage. While this may seem great, and safe, they are other ways to arrive at this destination and achieve the same result.</p>



<p>Here are a few ways to make this happen, and enjoy your new SSD cards, with all your files and programs in the right place.</p>







<h2>How to move your HDD to SSD</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Connect your USB to a SATA Drive</strong></h3>



<p>Yes, you read it correctly. Let us get started with the right connections in place to achieve our goals and set objective. Begin by connecting your SSD card, with your old HDD card and get them on a SATA Drive, all at the same time.</p>



<h3> 2. <strong>Get an AOMEI Backupper</strong></h3>



<p>Now that your HDD and SSD storage is connected, you will have to begin the process, by getting your files back up.</p>



<p>This is important for many reasons; the first is that a single click can erase your entire data, so you do not take chances with keeping your data safe on your computer, especially during this process.</p>



<p>Also, while partition, can work so fine and have your files saved in the right places. Backing them up on external memory will give you the needed extra layer of support, necessary to keep your files in the best hands. In the event of eventualities!</p>



<p>Therefore, the AOMEI Backupper will do a great job for you and help to keep your files together, just in case anything goes wrong. It is also a great program with which to clone your OS.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Back up your files</strong></h3>



<p>We have talked about the need to get your files backup, on connecting your AOMEI Backupper the next thing to do on this list, will be to back the files up and keep them in safe custody.</p>



<p>To make sure you are saving the right things only, ensure you delete redundant and unused files in your hard drive. </p>



<p>This will save up space, but importantly it will also allow you to save only the important things, and when you have them saved up, you are guaranteed the continued enjoyment of your storage. </p>



<h3>4. <strong>Plugin and initialize your SSD</strong></h3>



<p>At this stage we are assuming two things, first is the fact that your files had been backed up your hard drive, preferably as we stated, the external hard drive. Secondly, that your SATA Drive is still connected to your computer, if this is the case, we are in for the business.</p>



<p>Plugin your SSD into the SATA connected to a USB adapter and then initialize. During this, you will see the drive show up in the bottom part of the disk management screen, and you will have this captured by your AOMEI program.</p>



<h2>5. <strong>Clone your Hard Disk</strong></h2>



<p>On the left sidebar of your disk management screen, checking through AOMEI you will see two options; the first is to clone your disk, and the second to clone your system. The best and right option for this operation is to clone your disk and not your system.</p>



<p>On selecting the clone your disk option, you will be directed to choose your destination disk, choose the right disk here as it will be overwritten, you should be sure not to make a mistake on this one.</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Install your SSD</strong></h3>



<p>Now that you are done with the cloning process, you will need to install the operating system in your new storage and computer to allow it to function seamlessly, and in top gear.</p>



<p>If you followed the steps correctly, you will have all your saved data in check and intact as you get to this stage.</p>



<h3>7. <strong>Reboot</strong></h3>



<p>Just as it is with every other high-end system program installation, you will have to reboot your computer to get the best of it and have it function at its best. Interestingly, this will put your computer in shape for your functions later on.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Moving your OS from the HDD storage to the SSD can be the next best thing you will learn. With this option, you do not have to install your OS fresh; you just have to follow the process to be mentioned in this article, and boom, yes boom. Your results are guaranteed.</p>



<p>Also, if you are still on the fence, with what storage to use for your new computer. SSD is not just the way; very soon, you will not have the HDD storage again, as it is guaranteed to go extinct like other memory options before it. You are exposed to a completely new level with the SSD cards, and you cannot miss it.</p>



<p>Moving your OS from HDD to SSD is not a kill and something worth breaking the sweat for, it is a simple DIY operation that you can perform, with your eyes closed. Nevertheless, keep them open, so you do not erase your files in the backup process or overwriting phase.</p>



<p>If you followed through with all the steps outlined, we are sure you have attained your aim and you are in the best shape with your OS in the right storage device.</p>

<p>Many do not know the difference between <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> graphics card GPU, iGPU, and APU and so terms are sometimes used incorrectly. In this guide, we will show the difference between Graphics Card GPU IGPU and APU.</p>



<p><br>The main difference from an IGPU is the way the CPU and GPU can transfer information. The chip has the CPU and GPU on the same single die as some intel CPUs, but AMD’s APUs support Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA), allowing the CPU and GPU to be on the same bus, which allows for smooth communication. The steps are reduced for each instruction as the memory and tasks are shared.<br></p>



<p>So the acronyms APU, CPU, GPU, and iGPU are defined below:<br></p>



<p>APU: Accelerated Processing Unit.<br>CPU: Central Processing Unit.<br>GPU: Graphics Processing Unit.<br>GPU: Integrated Graphics Processing Unit, or integrated graphics processing unit.</p>



<h2>What are the differences and why are they so-called?</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the basics, the CPU. The CPU is the processor of a computer, the “brain” in charge of carrying out all the operations, and controls everything in the system.</p>



<h2>Graphics Card</h2>



<p>Graphics cards take many heavy graphical tasks away from the CPU and provide it to the GPU, where the GPU can use its own ram and processing power.</p>



<p>The GPU is a kind of processor that the dedicated graphics cards incorporate. Unlike the CPUs, its set of instructions and internal components are optimized for graphics. Although a CPU can perform most operations (not all) of a GPU and vice versa, since they are not optimized for this, the performance is substantially lower when operating the other&#8217;s functions, which is why they are two separate components.</p>



<p><br>GPU, also know as a graphics processing unit, is a processor designed for graphical computation. It manipulates and alters memory to create images in a frame buffer that can then be sent as video to a display. Many embedded systems use GPUs to take advantage of the highly efficient manipulation of computer graphics. This includes but is not limited to: PCs, Phones, and Game Consoles.</p>



<p>The term GPU came about from Sony in 1994 when referring to the PlayStation’s GPU. Nvidia later popularized in 1999, where they marketed the GeForce 256 as “the world’s first GPU” and went on to create the GeForce Series Graphics Cards. Like a CPU, a GPU requires its own memory and works with other components to complete scheduled tasks.</p>



<h2><strong>CPU-vs-GPU</strong></h2>



<p>Some CPUs can incorporate a graphics processor in the same die, called GPU, which is nothing but an integrated GPU, but it works independently. In this way, it is achieved that without the need for a dedicated graphics card, we can view the content on a monitor, although in these cases, the performance is quite low due to the physical limitations they have.</p>



<h2>Pros And Cons Of GPU</h2>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li> Fast in graphics-related and massively parallel jobs.</li><li>Can take on more demanding tasks.</li><li>Are excellent for matrix operations.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li> GPUs fail on branch prediction.</li><li> GPU can’t drive itself, needs a CPU to be controlled.</li></ul>



<h2>Intel-iGPU</h2>



<p>The memory is taken from your typical desktop ram. Because of this, faster dual-channel memory always works better with GPUs. Ports are obtained from your motherboard, and cooling is taken from your CPU Cooler.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Having an IGPU will usually always be slower than a dedicated GPU as it has to obtain and share resources from other components. Furthermore, GPUs tend not to be as fast as dedicated GPUs, which cause lower overall performance.AMD Accelerated Processing Unit or APU is a type of IGPU. AMD launched the APU in 2011 and is still used today.</p>
