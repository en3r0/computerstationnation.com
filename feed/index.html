<p>Here is that link to the Rosewell NEON M59 on Amazon &#8211; <a href="https://amzn.to/2tdozyC">https://amzn.to/2tdozyC</a></p>



<p>In case you want to read through the full transcript for the video, here you go:</p>



<p>all right so we are taking a look at the Roswell neon m59 so this is a pretty sweet gaming mouse ish I mean it can be a work mouse but it&#8217;s like a gaming style Mouse this guy DPI settings it&#8217;s got the RGB most importantly I enjoyed it I like it so I&#8217;m gonna bring you in for a closer look trying to do that okay so you may have seen in a previous video I just did on this awesome keyboard but today well now we are going to be focusing on this mouse which is pretty sweet looking and green I have to say about the mouse so I got this off Amazon I will link to that in the description below and full disclosure that will be an affiliate link to which I will get some sort of kickback so if you want to buy it through that that&#8217;s great if not that is okay as well so it&#8217;s got a pretty good reviews on here as you can see it&#8217;s got the RGB us like striping if you will this is the box that comes in it&#8217;s pretty standard except it&#8217;s it&#8217;s always interesting how you get a product offline and it looks like it&#8217;s meant to be on a show as far as I know it&#8217;s not a lot of Roosevelt products on shelves me me at a few computer stores that I left so I mean like I said standard stuff does have a nice braided cable which they advertise so I mean it feels really good you see the texture on there yeah that&#8217;s that so does come with a little instruction booklet which I actually had lost but you can always look this stuff up online too which I ended up doing so that being said let&#8217;s pull up the software that it comes with now if you saw the other video you&#8217;ll know that this thing does not come with software that being said I also love it so I will stop saying that being said we got um check it out you got steady you got color screaming I think that&#8217;s like the default and I set it to slow because I think that&#8217;s pretty cool you can see it does that nice striping no yeah it&#8217;s a little bit better so that&#8217;s that&#8217;s actually what I had it set to you for how long revenues almost two solid months now and that is because this software is only for Windows which makes sense you know I guess a lot of people use Windows I am personally a full-time Linux user unless it comes to gaming so but if by the off chance you are going to use this mouse under Linux you can change the settings here in Windows and they will it&#8217;s like it like writes it to the mouse or something I&#8217;m not entirely sure I&#8217;d be fun to figure out but those settings will carry over when you boot into Linux so I had it set to green to match the keyboard we also have like tail which it&#8217;s an interesting name for it I guess but it kind of just colors back and forth tailing tail at the color tails in because it&#8217;s not lit up constantly maybe that&#8217;s sort of saying you can do fast slow medium slow it would be interesting to check it out it&#8217;s pretty neat I always think the slow effects are better if you&#8217;re actually sitting and doing stuff oh cool so if you like this is if you click it&#8217;ll light up different colors um what else we got with the wave let&#8217;s try to wave the wave yep that is basically a tiny seizure don&#8217;t want that personally so yeah I am I just wanted a nice bright you set the brightness on it I just want it to match so I think it it looks pretty similar you know anyway so that is the the Roswell neon m59 I didn&#8217;t go into any of the DPI settings it&#8217;s pretty standard you can actually which I mean if you&#8217;re really into your sensitivity you can go in here and you can set the different level so like one this is you know one click then you click it again it&#8217;s level two click it again level three then it cycles through I just left him a default there pretty pretty fine they work in Linux as well um you can set all your speeds and portray down the why you&#8217;d want to go lower but again I&#8217;m not an uber pro gamer so you make use of that one thing that&#8217;s a fun to note is I did not pick its the macro you can set different macros in here could be seen as an unfair situation but it also could be awesome for productivity if you do a lot of clicky things with work stuff I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;ve never used mouse macros on a actual mouse setting level anyways guys thanks for watching hopefully you&#8217;ve enjoyed this small review on the mouse that I&#8217;m using currently and look forward to seeing you next time thanks for watching please hit subscribe if you liked this video</p>

<p>So I got a standing desk. As the title says, it was the SmartDesk 2 from Autonomous.</p>



<p>I have never owned a standing desk before, but I knew I wanted one after trying out standing and working on my laptop with different methods. It helps me focus more on the task at hand, and helps my body get a break from sitting all day (<a href="http://computerstationnation.com/desks/">not that I don&#8217;t love other awesome computer desks that you can view here</a>).</p>



<p>In a long roundabout way I found the SmartDesk 2 base and used my existing desk surface on it (probably will replace it later).</p>



<p>After using the desk for several months now, here is my review. The video is great, and the article provides even more detail.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe width="750" height="422" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFcfmgafxqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>







<h2>Assembly</h2>



<p>This thing was a breeze to put together. The instructions were very straight forward, I did not get lost when following them.</p>



<p>The only thing to note here is that this thing is super heavy, and you will need to turn it over a time or two. You may want a second set of hands to help, but was able to go it alone.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/battlestation-workstation-on-autonomous-smartdesk-2-790x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-558" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/battlestation-workstation-on-autonomous-smartdesk-2-790x1024.jpg 790w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/battlestation-workstation-on-autonomous-smartdesk-2-231x300.jpg 231w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/battlestation-workstation-on-autonomous-smartdesk-2-768x996.jpg 768w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/battlestation-workstation-on-autonomous-smartdesk-2-509x660.jpg 509w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Lifting Capacity</h2>



<p>This standing desk can lift 220 lbs! I laid on it and went up and down, and yes that was fun. This should be plenty of lift for your entire computer station.</p>



<p>Do note that the SmartDesk 2 &#8211; Business Edition has a lifting capacity of 300 lbs. This may come in handy if you are running giant CRT monitors still or something weird.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-smartdesk-2-motor.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-557" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-smartdesk-2-motor.jpg 800w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-smartdesk-2-motor-300x189.jpg 300w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-smartdesk-2-motor-768x484.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Stability</h2>



<p>The stability of this desk is great! I had previously looked at some standing desk that was on sale at Office Max and ready many reviews that the desk was not stable and it was very noticeable. Glad I avoided that.</p>



<p>The only time you notice a tiny bit of wobble is if you really shove the desk pretty hard, or when it is going up and down. Not a big deal for me since I am also going up and down with it.</p>



<h2>Noise</h2>



<p>This is not a silent desk by any means. There is an audible hum when adjusting the height of this desk. It does not bother me though.</p>



<p>It is a sound that a microphone would probably pick up, but then again so is the sound of the space heater that is next to me.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/epic-workstation-on-standing-desk.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-559" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/epic-workstation-on-standing-desk.jpg 800w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/epic-workstation-on-standing-desk-300x204.jpg 300w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/epic-workstation-on-standing-desk-768x522.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Adjustment Height Range</h2>



<p>The adjustment height range of the SmartDesk 2 is 29 inches &#8211; 47 inches. I am under 6 ft. tall, and I have no issues with how high it goes.</p>



<p>That being said, I do wish it went a little lower, just one or two inches to be flush with my arms.</p>



<p>The adjustment height range of the SmartDesk 2 &#8211; Business Edition is 24 inches to 51 inches. This could be a future upgrade.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-height-up.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-556" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-height-up.jpg 800w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-height-up-300x194.jpg 300w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-height-up-768x497.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Adjustment Height Speed</h2>



<p>The adjustment speed of SmartDesk 2 is 1 inch per second (compared to the Business Edition which is 2.3 inches per second). This speed is fine for me, I can take an extra second to stretch which I do any way.</p>



<h2>Controls</h2>



<p>The controls are pretty basic. You have 7 buttons on a panel that mounts under the desk. You can really place it any where you like. Instead of on the front I put mine off to the left side so it makes my desk look cleaner.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-controls.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-554" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-controls.jpg 800w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-controls-300x191.jpg 300w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-controls-768x490.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<p>One button helps you save a height, 4 buttons that initiate a saved height, and two buttons to go up and down. Pretty easy!</p>



<h2>Warranty</h2>



<p>Warranty has never been much of a selling point for me, but it can be a, &#8220;nice to have&#8221; sort of thing. The warranty of the home edition is 1 year, but the business edition is 5 years.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Should you buy the Autonomous SmartDesk 2? Yes, but as with all things, it depends on your exact needs. <a href="http://computerstationnation.com/desks/types-of-standing-desks/">There are also other types of standing desks to consider</a>.</p>



<p>If you are looking for a way to get standing more at your computer station, then the SmartDesk 2 is a great way to do it without completely breaking the bank.</p>
