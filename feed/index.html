<p>What comes to your mind when the idea of a man cave crosses your mind? I call mine ‚Äúa fortress of solitude‚Äù. It is that special room somewhere around the house that is fully dedicated to me, where I get to be myself and play by my own rules without being questioned.</p>



<p>A man cave is more than just a room. It is a personal sanctuary where you can be whatever you want to be without being bothered by anyone. It‚Äôs that place where you and your buddies can relax, grab some drinks and most importantly play some games.</p>



<p>Creating a gaming man cave that is both cool, tasteful and mature can be a bit tough especially when you have no idea what you want it to look like. While this post will take care of the cave itself, <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/desks/gaming-desks/">if you are looking for gaming desks</a>, check out that page.</p>



<p>That is why I decided to put together 30 gaming man cave ideas just for you. Trust me, you‚Äôll be oozing with beautiful pictures of how your gaming man cave should look like no matter the size or location of your room, moreover, what‚Äôs the purpose of having a man cave if you can‚Äôt show it off to your friends?</p>

<p>This wonderful hue lightning gaming man cave has an appeal that is both inviting and comfortable. Gaming is one activity that requires comfortability as a prerequisite and that is what this room offers starting from the couch to the entire set up. Its simplicity is accompanied by a bias modular lighting TV and a speaker that adds to the charm in this room. It has an incredible speaker that uplifts your sound system. I can‚Äôt imagine what playing a game without a super cool sound system would be like &#8211; boring and easily tiring. The importance of a sound system can not be overstressed. It contributes immensely to the liveliness of the room. This setting has a homely look that is charming in a soft way.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>I still can‚Äôt find the word that will do justice to this room. (You might wanna help out) because I think breathtaking is an understatement. If you‚Äôre finding it difficult to create that jaw-dropping lighting with just bulbs and fixtures, then you might want to consider trying LED lights to give your room this heavenly setting which has a cool look that easily creates the perfect atmosphere for games. It has a comfortable manly appeal that will sell you off as someone that is neat and tidy because that is what this room is all about. You could use a universal controller mounts to hang the controller perfectly under the TV to give it that perfect gaming appeal.</p>

<p>To the lovers of golf, it can also be an indoor sport. This perfect layout brings golfing to your very own abode. It gives the sport a serene and homely appeal that makes it ideal for any weather conditions. This means you can play golf in the comfort of your home without worrying about the weather. It is super easy to create by simply using well mowed artificial grass or a carpet that looks just like this. This room comes with a couch that is as cozy as it looks where you can comfortably strategize your moves and carry out other activities such as reading, thinking or discussing business.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>You‚Äôll agree with me that a game is super fun when played in the company of two to three friends. Gaming is an idea that brings people together. The beautiful thing about this layout is that you don‚Äôt have to wait for your turn. With an incredible and comfortable racing game chair fitted to a screen just at your sitting level, you can feel the heavens at that spot. Well, if you‚Äôre wondering what the big screen would be for, it can facilitate the addition of a fifth player. The room is fairly&nbsp;spacious which means you can still add more games and other accessories that suit your taste.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The set up of this cozy gaming room is both warm and pocket friendly. Unlike what you‚Äôve been thinking, setting up a gaming room doesn‚Äôt have to cost a fortune and it doesn‚Äôt have to take up much space. With an easy to make a shelf that is charming in its simplicity, you can easily keep track of your favorite stack of games and other collections that you fancy. The beautiful thing about this gaming man cave setting is that your collections and game controllers are within your reach.</p>

<p>This battle station gaming cave is definitely something to fall in love with. It has a heroic appeal that shows off your collections in class and style provided by the custom cabinet. It offers a heavenly sight to your collections especially with the recliner that is at the same level with your monitor to provide comfort without having to strain your neck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This matte white angular desk is custom built which means you can do it yourself or have a carpenter do it for you. The shelves built into the underside of the desk makes it a nice hiding place for wires, USB slots and whatever you don‚Äôt want to be clustering around on your desk.</p>

<p>A major reason why I love LED lightings is the sophistication it adorns your room with. These lights can be adjusted for brightness, RGB and other amazing effects&nbsp;that give your room the charm that a gaming man cave is supposed to have. An amazing thing about this setup is that it allows you the flexibility to multi-task, thanks to the three separate monitors and a reclining chair, you could be everywhere at the same time without stressing it. It also has a big TV screen that provides a larger display and can also serve a purpose that is entirely different from what the other monitor does.</p>

<p>This setup is perfect for your basement. The floors are made of waterproof vinyl planks to prevent you from losing all your highly prized and personal stuff that adorns your man cave. It is the perfect solution especially if you live in areas that are highly prone to flooding. One important item that you wouldn‚Äôt want to lose is your furniture especially if it is a leather couch. Having a leather chair is widely attested to be great for gaming. It is super comfy for playing games while having a nice cold drink. This room is also perfect if you do not fancy having a bar in your man cave- a refrigerator does the job well.</p>

<p>A lot of guys have an impressive collection ranging from games such as n64, super famicom, Saturn, sega cdx , dream cast, turbo duo, PS2, NES, master systems and game cube that needs to be well displayed in a way that makes it appealing to the other party as it is to them. This setting provides you with a great picture that is organized and tidy and still keeps its manliness at a top-notch. The tidy high shelves bring to mind an idea of how you could perfectly display your trophies like the prized possessions that they are while giving the TV and its strong TV stand a great display.</p>

<p>The 65 inches tv is the most outstanding feature of this man cave. A bigger screen makes the images appear very clear and more realistic which creates the perfect atmosphere for any kind of game. The matching walls and sofas add to the calmness of this cave. It is a perfect fortress for relaxation, many thanks to the LED smart home lights that are adjustable to any preferred color and Monster LED light strips that are quite affordable. It is scarcely furnished but the few furniture adorns the room in a cozy way.</p>

<p>Another wonderful place you could set up your man cave Is in the attic. It provides you with natural light and a feeling that is kingly especially as you get to oversee other activities around your neighborhood without being noticed. The window could also serve as a perfect getaway for a little distraction when you are tired of playing games. You should also include a gaming recliner in your room for more comfort and ease.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The manly and classy elegance of this man cave speaks for itself. It is dominating in a silent yet appealing way. If you‚Äôre the kind that prefers a bigger screen over everything else, then this room is made just for you. It has a rack that is large enough to hold your receiver and your wires so you don‚Äôt make a mess out of everything. The tasteful desk has a calm color that matches the walls. The heavenly black leather chairs also provide a comfortable feeling to the secured feeling that this cave holds.</p>

<p>This has a central theme in mind. If you&#8217;re a die-hard fan of rocket leagues, then your fantasy just played out. It is built in a particular fashion that displays a deep love for a particular game. It can be recreated in a way that speaks volumes about&nbsp;your love for a game without appearing childish at all. This hearty room is designed in a way that allows for a fair quantity of light, placing your couch just between the tv and the game table which affords you the comfort of doing either in a way that is pleasant to you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This setting can warm the heart of virtually anybody, especially your female buddies and kids. It is clearly the end result of dedication and a blazing passion for a game that needs a soft touch hence its color. The concept behind most gaming caves is our inability to let go of our adolescence and having our cherished desire and youthfulness staring right at us in a place where no one forces you to be anything other than yourself. This cave speaks to both a full-grown man and a teenager with it‚Äôs well organized and tasteful display of figurines and any other collectible you may have.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre a fan of multi-colored lights, then you might want to consider this. This light gives it a look that is hungry for adventure and that desired adventure will play out well if you&#8217;re gaming in a room like this. The play station light displayed under the monitor contributes to the heavenly feeling of playing a game. I&#8217;ll recommend this setup if, like me, you don&#8217;t mind being surrounded by screens that are not so far apart from each other.</p>

<p>This does look like a painting but it is so real. It is a wonderful place for men because of its relaxing theme that is both refreshing and strength filled. So, if you‚Äôre considering throwing away some of your old items and furniture, frames,&nbsp;poles, mirrors and other things, you should consider putting them into creative use by creating a man cave with a wall that looks like this. The well-polished look gives it an Irish theme that is sophisticated and charming coupled with its cool pallet board wall. It conveniently houses a great pub which has space for beers, wines and some food or snacks which means you barely have to go out once you‚Äôre in here.</p>

<p>LED lights are an amazing way to decorate a man cave. The RGB 5050 light strips coupled with the purple string lights, LED channels and diffusers gives the room a heroic feel that places everything right without any being more catching than the other. With a nice shelf to stock your collection of games and movies. You can barely run out of space in a room like this one. An example is the dual monitor mount that holds a 35 and 27 inches monitor which makes the difference in size barely noticeable because of the monitor adapter used for leveling the heights of the monitors. The well placed 8 inches gladiator workbench has enough room for items which contribute to the organized feel of the cave.</p>

<p>Having a lot of incredible game collections and sizable carpentry to stack them can be tiring when trying to figure out how you want your cave to be like. You might want to consider giving your man cave this look. The number of shelves in the room does add to the charm in it; making the room tidy, neat and manly and very organized. The recliner leather chairs are also very comfortable and can be easily substituted for a different purpose when the need arises.</p>

<p>A spacious basement should have this look. This cave is a tasteful and well-planned setup that has both a video gaming space and a classy pool table, each fairly apart from each other. The pool table has enough rooms for the sticks and fluance standing speakers in front, center, pole sides and rear that helps in setting a mood for any game of your choice. The looks are similar to a serene environment that can also be a getaway from distractions and help you think better.</p>

<p>Who doesn‚Äôt love RGB?. Even girls love RGB. A vapor colored Scheme fits into any weather condition. Cool for hot weather and warm for the winter season. This room can even defeat the purpose of a living room because you just wouldn‚Äôt want to go out. The 16ft. ‚Äúsuper night‚Äù RGBW with a magic home controller that can be easily controlled from your phone or PC. The inviting look of the couch is credited to the LEDs under the couch that is powered by a rubber car sleeve that matches the carpet which immensely contributes to the intoxicating look of this cave.</p>

<p>Lighting is an important part of a gaming room and this sight testifies to that fact. It will do your eyes a lot of good if they have something to distract them when being focused on the screen and this is what this clean princely look does. With a setting like this, you don‚Äôt have to worry about getting your eyes strained while playing games( the lights behind tv takes care of this ) It also has an adjoining bar where you could act as a pretend bartender while having some drink with your friends without having to worry about missing a single picture on the big tv screen.</p>

<p>If the lady of the house has given you permission to set up your own man cave in the basement after serious considerations, then this look will do justice to pacify her because this setting has a family theme attached to it. If you‚Äôre considering throwing away that table because you think it‚Äôs old school, you might want to reconsider by turning it into a pool table. This setting is fairly spacious in its different compartment which means you and your friends can play different games and grab some beers while at it without having to worry about discomfort.</p>

<p>Giving your gaming cave a look like this is like bringing sunset to your own very abode. This heavenly look could be yours by simply using a hue light strip lighting on the bulbs, behind the TV and even the couch (all with a nightglow tagged preset). The lighting has a flexible effect that allows you to change the colors to whatever you want such as setting a timer that changes it to white during the day and slowly turning into this look during evenings is a nice idea to help cool off after a stressful day at work. Most hue lights come with adhesive strips so you could fit it into whatever corner that you want.</p>

<p>A gaming cave doesn‚Äôt have to be built with a particular game in mind. This room is quite spacious which means that more gaming equipment can be added to further improve its look. It has a nice and easy to carry table where you can play table games without getting in the way of your buddy that&#8217;s playing with the pinball machine or watching video games. The bar stand is situated away from the entire gaming layout which gives it a whole vibe that is different from what the gaming&nbsp;room professes. The beautiful yet soft Led light behind the tv and at the bar stand provides a nice contrast that adds to the unique beauty of the room.</p>

<p>The importance of a big tv screen for gaming cannot be overemphasized. It has a thrilling and overwhelming effect on its players, offering them a nice and bigger picture of the game. This cave has a nice setup starting from the couch to the desk and the LED lights that gives the room a central look. It is perfect for a man that doesn‚Äôt want much light in his cave, preferring to make it look sacred, off-limits and a bit dark, all factors working in togetherness to produce a cozy feeling that is unique to him.</p>

<p>A lot of guys are in love with more than one gaming idea. What better way to ensure that the love for all keeps burning without the other feeling cheated than having it all in your room. This room contains arcade 1-up machines especially if you‚Äôre a fan of having your own arcade. Each has two to four games on it excluding the Atari 12 in one which has 12 amazing games on it. The amazing thing is that they are like real arcade rooms which gives it an original feeling. The games can be customized to suit whatever purpose you want such as adding a better rack ball and spinner, changing the buttons and joystick, readjusting or changing the light marque, replacing the internals with a PI or PC, or even changing the whole outlook.</p>

<p>Everyone has creativity that should be expressed from time to time. This room comes as a perfect opportunity to display your love for art in a style that is both beautiful and unique to you. In a situation where you can&#8217;t create this sticker by yourself, an artist can help out, but it will be fun creating such charming stickers that will be adorning your room either alone or with the help of close friends.. An incredible appeal this room has is the cool game collections such as the digital pinball machine, the arcade machine, the nicely built shelf, the table and a tv that is just perfect for the room.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Having a man cave that doubles as a gaming room is the perfect solution for those of us who can‚Äôt bring ourselves to outgrow our love for video games (for Pete‚Äôs sake, who can?).</p>



<p>Having that room that is solely dedicated to your games without you having to bother about disturbing other people outside the room (thanks to soundproof walls that allows you to keep the volume on your sound system as high as you like it) or you being disturbed by anybody should look inviting, comfortable and definitely has a unique appeal to it.</p>

Like all cherry wood desks, this piece of furniture is durable and is modestly designed for privacy.&nbsp; Amazingly, it weighs 40.8 pounds, with a 35.5 inches length on each side and 46 inches over the middle. It is a perfect get away from the familiar big desks that you are used to.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>It‚Äôs metal to metal cam lock connection provides reliable hold</li><li>It‚Äôs laminate construction makes it very durable</li><li>It is easy to assemble and clean</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>It is small and without drawers to accommodate other items and thus will need extra pieces of furniture for this purpose</li><li>It can not support two users at the same time</li></ul>

Here is one super sturdy computer desk with cable management that offers a 55-inch working surface that is both scratch and water-resistant.&nbsp; This desk is also quite durable and capable of handling a lot of vertical weight and pressure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This product features on our list due to the aesthetics and synthetic material that renders solidarity to the overall structure. Completely wobble-free, this computer desk from Topsky also brings forth a multi-function storage unit, clubbed with a flipping cover for accommodating cables.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is one of the few computer desks that hide cords and amplifies the outlook of the working space. However, it is the inclusion of high-end laminate and reinforced steel that makes it a must buy.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Grommet Hole that flips and allows you to place cables with deftness</li><li>8.5-inch deep yet functional bookshelf</li><li>P2 Board that flaunts water-resistance and environment-friendliness</li></ul>

<p>We start our discussion with a feature-packed set, best suited for smaller office spaces and a restricted workforce. This executive office furniture set from Bestar boasts of excellent manufacturing materials, including the commercial-grade laminate and high-density P2 board. The melamine finish further adds to the aesthetic credibility of this office suite.</p>



<p>The structural brilliance continues with the 1-inch thick working surface and the brushed handles carved out of nickel. When it comes to storage, this is one of the few executive office furniture suites to stack in a utility drawer, hutch, multiple shelves, file cabinet, and a dedicated bookcase. The workplace where you accommodate the monitor also features a sliding channel for the keyboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this product excels in the cable management department courtesy of the intuitive grommet bridge which is reversible in nature. Moreover, you can also choose the U-shaped variant of this furniture set to accommodate an additional professional into the mix. Besides offering a workstation that is stain-proof, immune to wear and tear, and scratch-resistant, the company sweetens the pot further with an ergonomic chair. The height-adjustable sitting option also features sturdy armrests and innovative lumbar support.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Commercial-grade product with is resistant to wear, spills, and stains</li><li>A sizeable working space of almost 70 inches</li><li>Excellent arrangement of shelves, cabinets, file drawers, and hutch</li></ul>

<p>If you are interested in modern executive office furniture or rather a suite for accommodating several professionals at once, this U-Shaped set from Bush Business certainly fits the bill. This product flaunts thermally infused work surfaces and laminates. The working area or the desk top is therefore resistant to scratches and occasional stains. Moreover, the structure is extremely durable with every element featuring a 1-inch thickness.&nbsp;</p>

This product is extremely innovative and durable with the separate working surfaces capable of being connected as two standalone desks, l-shaped structure, or a peninsula, depending on user preferences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This product from Bush Business combines affordable elegance with important structural components. Moreover, the structural banding technology is at the helm which resists any kind of dents, especially during transit and relocations. Last but not least, here is one office furniture set that brings forth a decent collection of slide-out panels, shelves, and cabinets for additional productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p>For a more creative yet professional setup, the cubicle furniture set from Bush Business is the perfect contender. While the Hansen cherry finishing improves the aesthetic credibility of the element, it is the excellent quality of the laminate that steals the show. To start with, the device flaunts several structural innovations, including steel, fabric, and wood as the manufacturing inclusions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides that, every cubicle flaunts a dedicated hutch, featuring tack board and back panels with proper finishing. The best thing about this luxury executive office furniture set is that it translates to a corner desk with a maximum working space of almost 48 inches. The company also allows you to pair accessory task lights with the product.</p>



<p>Some of the more standout attributes include the availability of self-closing storage units and hinges clubbed with the availability of other storage units and smaller cabinets. This product brings forth two shelves that are fixed and four adjustable units, making way for concealed storage support. Last but not least, the cubicle office set also comes with decent cable management support.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Extremely durable with scratch-proof laminate</li><li>Inclusion of six storage shelves; two fixed and four adjustable</li><li>Self-closing, innovative hinges add to the productivity of this furniture set</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The installation process is extremely time-consuming&nbsp;</li><li>Doesn‚Äôt support standalone usage</li></ul>

<p>Editors‚Äô Rating- 4.5 out of 5</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>While these are some of the best executive office furniture suites in the market, you must ascertain the requirements before making the purchase. Despite each product having its utility, we would personally recommend the L-shaped or U-Shaped suite from Bush furniture, provided you are looking to set up an expansive corporate establishment.</p>



<p>For better demarcation, the cubicle series is the best possible choice. However, if you are only looking for a compact space with an ergonomic chair and dedicated storage units, the standalone and affordable product from Bestar is the one to go with.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t like any of these three options, feel free to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=computersta08-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=19641f20736026d150518dbf1f9f95a4&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Executive Office Furniture Set">continue browsing</a> over on Amazon.</p>

In the subsequent sections, we shall talk about three products that are quite popular and retailing over select online platforms.</p>

<p>Here is a solid wood computer armoire that features several additional structural elements like a dedicated hutch, a separate cabinet for the CPU, and even a keyboard-storing shelf. However, the aesthetics associated with this product are different as compared to a basic computer desk with doors. On this innovative product from SELVA, we get open-ended panel doors with an armoire frame to rely on.</p>



<p>Other essential specs include the storage cubby for the CPU and the pull-out shelf for keyboards and additional documents. What stands out is the inclusion of three adjustable yet open shelves, capable of accommodating printers and other home essentials. This product works as a convenient workspace and frees up a lot of home and office space. However, you can always close the doors once the work is over and the products, in its entirety, looks like a towering, 52‚Äù cabinet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The manufacturing quality, involving engineering, water-resistant wood further adds to the credibility of this intuitive computer desk with doors. Besides that, there are soft yet durable hinges with metallic undertones which make door closing easier as compared to other desks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This computer armoire desk from SELVA has an overwhelming presence but it looks quite aesthetic, provided you are considering this as your home workstation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Featured printer shelf and CPU cubby</li><li>Inclusion of three sizeable shelves that are height adjustable</li><li>Sturdy frame with good-looking panel doors</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Humongous structure</li><li>Wide Armoire desk that takes up enough space</li></ul>

<p>This product features on our list purely on the basis of the aesthetics and antiqued finishing elements. Although you can use this as a corner armoire computer desk, it primarily comes across as a solid wooden structure with multiple structural elements. When it comes to manufacturing quality, this product flaunts high-quality engineered wood, clubbed with paint finish and sturdy yet soft hinges with metallic underlining.</p>



<p>In terms of structural components, the Sauder Harbor computer armoire desk provides a space-saving section at the top which acts like a hutch and accommodates select decorative elements. The majority of the desk body features open cabinets for storing keyboard, printers, CPU, and whatnot. The expansive storage unit for the monitor is adequate enough for basic to advanced professional requirements.</p>



<p>The slide-out sections make way for a versatile storage unit. However, the entire workstation can be encapsulated courtesy of the louvered door panels. When closed, the product looks like a 68‚Äù cabinet with a 10‚Äù inch open hutch at the top. The best thing about this computer armoire is that it has multiple sub-sections within the 68-inch structure, capable of freeing up a lot of home and office space.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There are several versions of computer armoire desks that are currently retailing online. However, we have listed three of the most usable options, based on their functional nature and enviable versatility.</p>



<p>The final selection, however, is at your discretion. For instance, if you are looking for a computer armoire with louvered panel and doors, you can opt for the ones featured by SELVA and Sauder. However, if you are looking for a more aesthetic selection for your office or home, with open-ended shelves, the Walker Edison desk is the one to purchase.</p>

<p>Gaming is timeless. Whether you are battling it out in the vintage &#8216;Street Fighter&#8217; series or navigating your way through the modern &#8216;Fortnight Battle Royale,&#8217; playing video games is an unmatched feeling and experience. Maybe you are an impulsive teenager enjoying your summer vacations or a 30-something-year-old reminiscing about the younger, better days, either way video games are just good fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaming also presents a host of advantages. Apart from enhancing memory and coordination, it also improves your attention span and quickens your brain. Additionally, playing online with people from all across the globe, with different backgrounds, ethnicities, and beliefs, eliminates discrimination, and instills the values of love, brotherhood, and equality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a gamer, you are always looking for ways to maximize your experience. There are several factors that you might want to consider, such as the room size, speaker strength, game-reclining chair, TV/projector, and gaming TV stand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we present several ideas about setting up your game room.</p>



<h2>Less is more</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/g1x6g1/completely_reasonable_apartment_setup/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">completely reasonable apartment setup</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>You do not always need to dedicate an entire room to your gaming activities. Reddit user, <em>Wuvica</em>, shows how you can effectively utilize a limited amount of space to set up a desirable gaming system.</p>







<h2>On the go</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/7htiap/im_a_truck_driver_with_a_pc_and_a_dream/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I&#8217;m a truck driver with a pc and a dream</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>What is better than having your gaming setup? Having your gaming setup in your vehicle. With a truck set up with a computer gaming system, Reddit user, <em>BudgieBeater</em>, is living the ultimate dream of every gamer.</p>



<h2>A battlestation in a van</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/cetna0/i_live_in_a_van_and_this_is_my_battle_station/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I live in a van and this is my battle station!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Another gaming system set up inside a vehicle. If the idea of living in a van and waking up to a new scene every day is not tempting enough, add to it the pleasure of having your favorite video games at your disposal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Peaceful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/bx4csz/i_call_itserenity/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I call it&#8230;Serenity</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This setup by Reddit user <em>thedesigner2011</em> is all kinds of serene. The monitors used are Samsung CRG9 and Acer X34, while the IKBC MF87 keyboard and the Ascend Acoustics Sierra 2 speakers just add to the overall fun and experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Cool and creative</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/88mrjw/the_gum_ball_pc_tried_to_be_different_and_fun_on/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">The Gum Ball PC. Tried to be different and fun on this build.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This is one of the most unique setups on this entire list. With multiple monitors, a gaming keyboard, and a gumball to go with, this buildup will earn applause from any dedicated gamer.</p>



<h2>Less is more</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/7y1byy/can_i_join_your_ranks/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Can I join your ranks?</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As a gamer, a private space that optimizes your focus is everything. This gaming setup by <em>Daxiongmao87 </em>shows that a genuine gamer can set up an effective gaming setup within a space that might be perhaps nonexistent to ordinary people.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bedroom setup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/cb07be/my_setup_is_finally_finished_after_3_years_of/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My setup is finally finished after 3 years of part time job savings!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A rack full of video games, a desk lined up with a sophisticated gaming setup, a cozy-looking bed, and a TV being used as a wallpaper, is all kinds of fresh and classy. Getting your monitor to swivel towards the bed will allow you to enjoy TV shows and movies as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Combine gaming with music</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/85ikwj/my_music_gaming_room/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My Music / Gaming Room</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This setup, belonging to Reddit user <em>Bokemoke</em>, is a dream for people who love gaming as much as they love music. To achieve the desired effect, throw in vibrant, blue lighting into the mix.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Battlestation with a view</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/b1s9fi/update_my_brooklyn_battlestation/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Update: My Brooklyn Battlestation</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It is a lie that gamers, once in front of their gaming setups, do not care about the outside world. This setup from an apartment in Brooklyn shows that a beautiful view overlooking a gaming system just adds to the overall beauty and fun.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bed away</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/8pkdt1/confined_to_bed_after_surgury_built_this_in/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Confined to bed after surgury &#8211; built this in anticipation</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>If you are one of those gamers who enjoy their games like they enjoy their games &#8211; in bed &#8211; this one&#8217;s for you. Additionally, such a setup is also beneficial for bedridden people due to an injury or a disease and need something to pass the time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Minimal but elegant</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/ecsn1u/my_minimal_setup/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My minimal setup</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Again, you do not need infinitely deep pockets to set your dream battlestation up. This setup, consisting of a whitewashed wall, a few aesthetic paintings, and a gaming computer, shows how to make the optimum use of limited resources.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Simplicity is graceful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/f1mdto/hows_my_set_up_everyone/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">How&#8217;s my set up everyone?</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Not everyone enjoys playing video games in a funkily-lighted, fancy looking game room. Sometimes, you just need a bit of calm and ease to maximize your gaming performance (especially if you are a dog).</p>



<h2>A gaming fort</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/e7cghq/the_den/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">The Den</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A gamer does not ask for anything more than a tiny, secluded world of his own, where he can stuff all his gaming equipment, sit back and enjoy the ride. This gaming den constructed by Reddit user <em>UncleViper</em> comes pretty close to such a world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Neat and pretty</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/fz468j/simple_and_clean/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Simple and clean</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Who says that gamers are messy and disorganized? This battle station, set up by Reddit user <em>superstrm</em>, is the very definition of organized. With white-colored walls, a spotlessly clean table, and sophisticated wall-hangings, someone might easily mistake this gaming setup as an office in an organization.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Maximum experience</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/8bqfoa/screen_real_estate/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Screen Real Estate</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With a monitor that is 49.4 inches wide, this setup brings you as close to a lifelike gaming experience as you can get. Additionally, the roller skate wheels on the chair allow it to glide effortlessly across all kinds of surfaces.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Stands out</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/f9c2i6/my_wallet_and_i_are_not_talking/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My wallet and I are not talking</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With a massive HD monitor, some of the top gaming equipment, and 3D wall panels designed by Art3D, this gaming setup might cost you a few bucks but will be worth every penny.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why play in one place?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/g6nvll/living_in_a_van_doesnt_mean_you_cant_have_a_nice/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Living in a van doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t have a nice battlestation.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Yet another battle station set up in a van &#8211; well, what can we say; we are absolutely in love with the idea. Living in a van does require some vast sacrifices, but it is worth it, especially when you can be in proximity to your ideal gaming system.</p>



<h2>A sunset to die for (in a game, of course)</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/fxi3zr/admiring_the_sunset_while_working_from_home/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Admiring the sunset while working from home</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Just ignore those long lines of code on the monitors&#8217; screens, and check out the gorgeous sunset in the background. Now, imagine yourself tearing the opponents apart on that massive monitor screen, with such a stunning natural backdrop. Do we need to say more?</p>



<h2>A battle in the forests</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/fw5nlj/2020_setup/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">2020 SetupüçÉüåø</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This gaming setup has been installed in a friendly, secluded outhouse in the Pacific Northwest. Surrounded by greenery and nature, the natural breeze entering the room will allow you to remain energized and focused for as long as you play.</p>



<h2>Benefitting from the basement</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/g5vcn4/who_else_had_to_utilize_their_unfinished_basement/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Who else had to utilize their unfinished basement into their work from home office? I&#8217;m trying to take full advantage.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Unused basements are a goldmine for gamers looking to set up a full-fledged gaming room &#8211; you have space and the required privacy. Reddit user <em>fortierj</em> is utilizing his basement as his home workspace, but it is not difficult to see how it can be used as an ideal gaming setup as well.</p>



<h2>Gold</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/6jieb8/pretty_happy_with_how_this_turned_out/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Pretty happy with how this turned out</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The color combination in this room is absolutely stunning &#8211; everything matches beautifully, even down to the painting on the wall and the rug decorating the floor. As a gamer, you understand the importance of synchronization, and therefore, of this room.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Soothing</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/avplup/my_minimal_battlestation/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My minimal battlestation</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The color white has a beauty that is unmatched by any other color. This minimalist gaming setup, complemented by white-colored walls and a spotless desk, has a peaceful aura about it.&nbsp;</p>
