<p>Yes, these speakers have been in use for 15+ years on and off. Check out my cheap speaker upgrade that sounds awesome!</p>



<p>Also, here is the auto translate text from YouTube if you are into that:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">welcome back to the computer station<br>nation YouTube channel my name is Dustin<br>Montgomery it's been a while since we've<br>been filming stuff but that's because a<br>lot of personal changes in my life<br>anyways check out so I've been using<br>these speakers on and off since like<br>2003 there are these crazy speakers that<br>attach to the side of your monitor<br>obviously this was a big CRT back in the<br>day you just they just slot it into<br>these little holes on the side of the<br>miner and I've been using them on and<br>off ever since at one point I switched I<br>had giant stereo speakers were talking<br>something like three foot high it was<br>crazy but I moved around well since I<br>lived in my parents house when that<br>happened and I've just taken these with<br>me because they just work they just have<br>a single audio plug in yes they didn't<br>have standard colors back or they didn't<br>they messed it up back with compact<br>manufactured these speakers so it's not<br>it's not always the same color that it<br>is now anyways these things are super<br>quiet because they don't have any<br>external power but what I've been doing<br>when I when I have these set up is I<br>just set them on the stand right behind<br>the monitor so this is a triple monitor<br>mount you may have seen it with the<br>other videos check out they just sit<br>like right behind here and they get the<br>job done but they are terrible so it's<br>finally time that I retired them<br>I've had these amazon basic speakers on<br>my Amazon wishlist for like I years six<br>years but no one's ever purchased them I<br>just never follow through because these<br>are getting a job so finally somebody<br>bought them for me this past Christmas I<br>was like four months ago we moved<br>coronavirus whatever let's set these<br>things up and we're gonna start with an<br>unboxing just to see what's inside are<br>two versions of this one with AC power<br>and one<br>that is usb-powered I went with the AC<br>power just because obviously coming from<br>the one just because it didn't have a<br>lot of power I was like you know these<br>probably can go a little bit louder with<br>that not sure that's the case<br>officially but there are different<br>settings especially in your linux where<br>you can drag the volume over with the<br>max is supposed to be gets a little<br>distorted but if you need the volume so<br>i did open this previously several<br>months ago just to make sure that all<br>the parts in it there is some kind of<br>instructions nothing really exciting so<br>yeah here it is AC powered uh really not<br>a lot to say about it it's got a nice<br>volume yeah that's pretty nice very<br>simple volume control on off and even a<br>place for your headphones which I did<br>not realize existed so you can see it's<br>got a nice little headphone jack<br>I actually might use that so oh heck the<br>on and off that's nice so these are<br>still small enough that I could probably<br>set them on the stand behind the monitor<br>here let me go ahead and get these<br>things set up and I'll give you a sneak<br>peak what that looks like<br>alright so here we are taking a look at<br>the back of the triple monitor stand<br>here and as you can see we've got the<br>speakers right now they're just resting<br>there which worked well when we had the<br>old ones because they were long enough<br>that they were stable obviously this is<br>not ideal<br>I should probably tie a tie on I<br>strapped weight tie wraps<br>anyway the old plastic just hold them<br>down a little bit but yeah so you could<br>either mount them sure straight over the<br>air down at the desk whatever you find<br>works best but this way you know they're<br>nice and hidden but you can see it's a<br>pretty clean setup still you know you<br>don't have to look at the speakers if<br>you want to adjust the volume manually<br>you just reach over the monitor stand up<br>whatever you got to do but other than<br>that keeps them out of the way hidden<br>pretty well so there you have it the<br>Amazon basics computer speakers for your<br>desktop AC powered I'll put a link in<br>the description but yeah upgrading the<br>speakers on the cheap yeah I suppose one<br>important thing here is I forgot is if<br>you're wondering how these things sound<br>it's pretty very good just tension it<br>out with one of the videos I made<br>previously if you haven't checked it out<br>go ahead and check out the other videos<br>on this channel this one's the final<br>build of the computer you see right next<br>to this so yeah here's here's a test if<br>that you know helps inform your decision<br>on this purchase not the deepest base<br>but still pretty good<br>so this is gonna be great for just you<br>know casual listening there you have it<br>pretty awesome speakers go check out<br>this video maybe it'll be somewhere on<br>the screen where this finger is at head<br>over to computer station nation calm if<br>you haven't already got some great<br>guides over there on what to buy next so<br>good luck with your battle station or<br>workstation setup and we'll talk to you<br>next time</pre>

<p>Want to buy a laptop but don’t know what to look for? Then, read our article. Here, you will find the top <strong>things to consider when buying a laptop</strong>, even if you don’t know the ABC of a laptop.</p>



<p>Buying a laptop is more hardened than purchasing a car. You can have a test drive and check the car before buying, but you can’t have a test run before buying a laptop. So, if you don’t have a clear idea of the laptop and it’s specifications, then it can be something like that you get what you don’t want.</p>



<p>However, in this content, we have to sum up almost all the things that you should know or check for before you buy it.</p>



<h2><strong>Things to Consider When Buying a Laptop</strong></h2>



<p>Before going to buy a laptop at first consider the fact that for what purpose you will use the laptop. Whether it’s for gaming, official use, or for general use. For different purposes, you will need different specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, here we have discussed all the considerations now whether you desire to buy for general use or gaming purpose doesn’t matter. Just read it and have definite ideas.</p>



<h3><strong>Look for a Good Brand</strong></h3>



<p>Before buying a laptop, at first, choose a good brand then look for the features in them. Because if you want the elements, then sometimes you can’t find the brand compatible with them. So, select the brand first, which one you prefer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a wide range of brands you will get. But all of them are not highly preferable. If you want to use the apple software, then you can choose the MAC series. And if you want for gaming, then you can select Hp, Asus, Dell, Acer,&nbsp; Lenovo with windows operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, Chromebook laptops have come with Google operating systems that are really being popular among some users. You can check for that also, but that will not be preferable for high-level gaming purposes.</p>



<p>Now let’s jump up to the specifications that you should look for when buying.<br></p>



<h3><strong>External Considerations</strong></h3>



<p>We are going to start with the external aspects. Here, you need to think about the monitor, keyboard features, and plugin options.</p>



<h4><strong>&nbsp;Screen: The First One You Need to Check</strong></h4>



<p>Well, it’s the first thing you should check. There are different types of display features you will find. The IPS(In Panel Switching) or even the display with OLED ( Organic Light Emitting Diode) display with 1920X1080 resolution is the best and improved one for HD resolution image/video support.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Size</strong></h4>



<p>If you think about the monitor size, then there are 11 inches to 17 inches, even 18-inch display available. But which one you should select it depends on how you are going to use it.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If you wish to carry it all the time, then try to choose between 13-15 inches, no need to buy the larger screen as it will lead to extra weight. And if you think your laptop is going to be stayed on your table all the time, then you can go for a 17/18 inch monitor for a good viewing option.</p>



<h4><strong>Display Type&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>You will find two types of display- touchscreen or regular. As it’s an era of touchscreen devices, so everyone tends to search for a stylish, comfortable touchscreen display. But we recommend the typical screen for laptop because touchscreen display gets glossy and reflective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, if you are buying the laptop for gaming purposes, then you should not choose the touchscreen one, somewhat standard display with high performing features. But if you need it for general use and want the style, not the performance, then you can choose the touchscreen.</p>



<h4><strong>Detachable/Foldable Laptop: Want Some Trendy Designs?</strong></h4>



<p>Nowadays, some laptops are available with detachable technology. You can fold the screen at a 180-degree angle and use the laptop as a tab. But it can cost you more and sometimes don’t give a high performance.</p>



<p>Again, Chromebook laptops have come with a technology that you can detach the screen from the keyboard part and use it as a tab. But it is going to be much expensive one.</p>



<h4><strong>Keyboard Features: Check Your Preferences</strong></h4>



<p>For the keyboard, you also need to think while you are going to use the laptop for gaming or general use. If you want it for high-performance gaming, then look for the&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Key travel of max 2 mm</li><li>backlight options</li></ul>



<p>and if you are using the device for general or official work, then no need to have the backlights on keyboards. It will consume more battery power.<br></p>



<h4><strong>Plug-In- Options: Need some exclusions?</strong></h4>



<p>For external connections such as- internet cable connections, external hard drive connecting, speaker connecting for better sound quality, or even other USB ports, you should choose 3.0 USB port. It can give better performance at high speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can find even more, but that will cost more and no need for that also. Remember, the more ports can give you more connecting options.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Internal Considerations</strong></h3>



<p>Now external options are done, so let’s come in the internal-the main parts that will lead your operations. For internal components, you need to look for the CPU, the RAM, the GPU, the Cooler machine, Storage capacity, and the last one-the Battery. So let’s explore them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>CPU: The Core Part</strong></h4>



<p>We all know that the CPU is the central core part of any computing device. So, among internal parts, at first, you need to check for the best CPU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the task of a CPU is to process data, so you need the best processor. For a good performing processor, you can go for intel core i-3, i-5, or i-7, respectively. Now some models of AMD bring a good quality processor. But if you need for gaming purpose, then go for Intel series, and general use, you can choose AMD latest series.</p>



<h4><strong>GPU Should Also Be Kept in Consideration</strong></h4>



<p>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is to control and look after the graphical units. As in a laptop, the CPU &amp; GPU are coming as built-in options, and you can’t update them later so, you should choose the best one while buying.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If you think you have to work with a lot of graphical works or high performing games or video editing, then you should choose a better GPU of Nvidia or AMD series. If you don’t need a top-performing gaming or video editing works, then you don’t need to think much about GPU.<br></p>



<h4><strong>RAM for Working Speed</strong></h4>



<p>While you are checking for the things to consider when buying a laptop, you must check the RAM. You can find branded laptops having a RAM from 4GB to 64 GB also. But we recommend having at least 8 GB RAM. With that, you can do any tasks from entry-level to mid-level work and even work by opening many tabs or more than one software also.</p>



<p>But nowadays, people sometimes tend to have more RAM. But it can slow down your working performance and screen refreshing rate. So, 8 GB RAM is preferable, but with the less, you can do the general works like texting, mail checking, listening to music, and so on. With a RAM less than 8 GB, you can’t enjoy the taste of multitasking or even high-level modern games.</p>



<h4><strong>Storage Space</strong></h4>



<p>well, you need to check the storage capacities also. Now, there is a hard drive called SSD( Solid State Drive). With this hard drive, you can enjoy the full speed features. But note that SSD can cost you more.</p>



<p>If you can’t afford SSD, then you can go for the traditional HDD(Hard Drive Disk) with high storage capacities like- 1 TB can also be recommended. Also, you check the RPM( Revolutions Per Minute) of HDD and look for the 7200 RPM. It will give more speed.</p>



<p>Now Intel has brought a new technology HDD called-Intel Optane. You can buy it additionally and connect it to your laptop. It comes with 16 Gb/ 32 GB around. It’s for those who can’t afford SSD.<br></p>



<h4><strong>CPU Cooler:  Most People Forget About This</strong></h4>



<p>Well, CPU cooler comes as a built-in option on the laptops. So, many big branded companies forget about adding a good cooler. But if you are using your laptop for general use, then you don’t need a high performing liquid cooler. You can go with what the laptop has in-built.</p>



<p>But if you are using for gaming purposes, then you should check for a laptop with a high performing cooling device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oh if you also look for <a href="https://minitipsx.com/best-360mm-aio">360mm AIO cooler</a> for your another pc, you can check that link.<br></p>



<h4><strong>Battery Durability: The Last But Should Not Be The Least</strong></h4>



<p>As its a laptop, and you can use it as portable, so you should check for a battery giving long backup time. You should choose a laptop with a maximum of 8 to 10 hours of battery backup.</p>



<p>You should keep in mind that you have to consider 2 hours less than the given backup time. So, if there is written 10 hours backup, then consider it as 8, if 6 hrs then consider as 4 and so on.<br></p>



<p><strong>The Last One: Choose for The Upgradeable One</strong></p>



<p>Well, nowadays, laptop companies are making some laptops with upgradeable options. So if you can’t spend more now and want to upgrade later, then you can choose for the upgradeable one for further updating.</p>



<h2><strong>Final Words</strong></h2>



<p>The article is about almost all the things to consider when buying a laptop. By the end of reading this, you will surely have a clear idea about what to look for when you wish to buy a laptop. So, read it and purchase your desired laptop with our latest buying guidelines from complete research.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many companies have gone digital, and it’s made for some pretty impressive increases in productivity. According to a Business Index run by Staples, three out of four workers feel they don’t have the latest technology. A similar survey found that people who used the newest technology felt they increased their productivity by 7 percent.</p>



<p>Finding the optimal configurations for business computers isn’t easy, but if you examine things like hardware, software, security systems, and even Information Technology (IT) workstations, you can find the right combination to increase productivity. First, let’s take a look at how you can configure hardware to increase it.</p>



<h2>Hardware</h2>



<p>Towers, monitors, keyboards, mice, and even headsets are vital components to your desktop. Using the right equipment is an easy way to make things much more user-friendly, which leads to easier access for the worker to get more done in less time.</p>



<h3><strong>Monitors: The More, The Merrier</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/computer-monitors-for-work/">Some jobs require just one monitor</a>, but have you ever considered a dual-monitor system for your workstation? If your job requires frequent multitasking and the use of multiple applications, dual monitors can be a lifesaver.</p>



<p>It’s been shown that using two monitors at the same time increases productivity 20-30 percent. That’s an astronomical number when it comes to producing more results. One of the reasons this occurs is because you have an entirely new monitor to open up documents on. It saves you a lot of time and money using this type of setup, and it’s worth the initial investment.</p>



<p>Different jobs will have different uses for the dual monitors, but a lot of it comes down to simply having more room to open up multiple applications at once.</p>



<h3><strong>Robust Processors</strong></h3>



<p>No one likes a slow Graphical User Interface (GUI). It’s even more frustrating when your applications freeze. A sluggish GUI means losing time &#8211; especially if it happens multiple times a day.</p>



<p>To alleviate this situation, you need to utilize powerful processors that help mold your workstation into the best business computer in the building. The minimum specifications for processors depend on the software you use and the nature of work done on the machine, so it’s best to research before buying one.</p>



<p>For example, the applications used by accountants, architects, and artists will perform their best-using processors in the three gigahertz (GHz) range. Other jobs may need more or less GHz depending on how powerful the applications are.</p>



<h3><strong>Graphics Cards</strong></h3>



<p>Using basic office applications and email doesn’t require a powerful graphics card. But if art, design, or videography are a big part of your business, it’s worth investing in decent ones. Since most software comes with a list of recommended specifications, it’s a good idea to research the apps you’ll use before you buy.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>Making sure you have the right software for the work being done is essential. Even your operating system (OS) can make or break productivity. There is no formula for crafting the perfect software, as every company is slightly different. Fortunately, you can tailor the software to your business’s needs.</p>



<h3><strong>Operating Systems: What You Need to Know</strong></h3>



<p>Implementing an OS that is compatible with the software you want to use is a priority. If it’s compatible, it should run smoothly. It’s also crucial to upgrade your OS so that it’s the most updated version available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An outdated OS can lead to problems like hackers and other security breaches. And hackers slow down productivity. Finally, consider usability. An OS like Microsoft Windows is more well-known than Linux. Choose something that you know how to use, and it is easy for everyone to understand.</p>



<h3><strong>Personalized Software</strong></h3>



<p>Most businesses need basic software like a messaging system and writing applications. But specialized software that is helpful to the particular work being done can help productivity. For instance, utilizing Photoshop is an excellent idea if your company heavily deals with graphic design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Downloading Photoshop on a business computer that specifically runs accounting software bogs down the computer with unnecessary baggage. Use your head and select the appropriate software.</p>



<h3><strong>Backup and Cloud Storage</strong></h3>



<p>Cloud storage is essential for files and data that could be lost otherwise. File recovery software also provides a good backup for accidentally deleted files. Nothing slows down productivity like having to re-do an entire day’s work.</p>



<h3><strong>Time Keeping Software</strong></h3>



<p>Time tracking software is another option that can have significant benefits for productivity. Knowing who’s working and how much time they’re putting in can help you track their productivity.</p>



<h2>Ergonomic Workstations</h2>



<p>Comfortable employees are productive employees. When typical office supplies like chairs don’t do their job correctly, it can halt productivity. This is due to several reasons, including workers feeling like they’re neglected and even physical issues with their backs and spines.</p>



<h3><strong>Desk Chairs: Worth the Money</strong></h3>



<p>If you have to get up and stretch or walk every ten minutes, odds are not a lot of work is getting done. Focus requires being comfortable enough to devote your attention to the task at hand. The second most common reason Americans visit the doctor’s office is lower back pain. That’s millions of Americans taking time out of their jobs to get their health checked. And, since they’re not at their job, they can’t be productive.</p>



<p>When looking for comfortable office chairs, make sure they’re adjustable. Raising and lowering them is vital since not everyone is the same size. It’s beneficial to have chairs with adjustable backs, as well. Some people are more comfortable when they can lean back. Others have medical conditions and sitting completely upright for too long can become painful. An ergonomic desk chair might seem like a luxury, but it’s more likely to save you money in the long run.</p>



<h3><strong>Ergonomic Desks</strong></h3>



<p>Hardware can be added to desks that allow monitors to be raised and lowered. Keyboard platforms often come with the same benefits. <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/desks/">Desks that can be adapted</a> to take the chair out of the equation are becoming more and more popular. They help reduce back pain and increase energy and productivity.</p>



<p>Whether <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/desks/types-of-standing-desks/">the desks for your computer are for sitting or standing</a>, making them versatile and accommodating for all types of users will help bolster a productive workplace.</p>



<h2>Security</h2>



<p>A security incident is a quick way to grind things to a halt. Proper security configurations implement the three A’s of security: authentication, authorization, and accounting.</p>



<h3><strong>Authentication</strong></h3>



<p>Everyone working in your company needs a way to authenticate themselves before accessing anything. All workstations should require identifying credentials before granting log-ins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passwords are also an essential step in the identification process. They create an extra level of security and accountability. Productivity for things like business computers relies on having a safe and secure work environment. Make sure your computers are safe.</p>



<h3><strong>Authorization</strong></h3>



<p>Should an employee in marketing be able to use their credentials to access company payroll information? Probably not. The authorization ensures users are only allowed access to areas they need to perform their tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authorization tools from companies like NextLab also take into consideration time and location. For example, users from an accounting department could be locked out of accessing accounting files after 7 pm. Or, an attempted email login from an unrecognized device could be blocked.</p>



<p>All of this creates an atmosphere for optimal productivity by keeping unauthorized users out of the system.</p>



<h3><strong>Firewalls</strong></h3>



<p>Network security is crucial for productivity. Malware sneaking onto your computer or a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack can throw a wrench into the workflow. Secure firewalls protect your company from many types of attacks, including the ones mentioned above.</p>



<h3><strong>Spam Filters</strong></h3>



<p>Phishing attacks are another avenue for malware to reach your workstation. Since they’re frequently found in emails, implementing a spam filter is an easy way to keep things more secure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, things occasionally slip through these filters. This is why it’s essential to educate employees on safety and security in the digital world. Informed users can recognize phishing attempts, even if the email server doesn’t.</p>



<h3><strong>Encryption</strong></h3>



<p>Data encryption is the best way to make sure only authorized eyes see such sensitive information. Even the smallest of businesses can benefit from using encryption software. When the only pair of eyes approved to see the information sees it, productivity goes much more smoothly.</p>



<h3><strong>Proper Disposal</strong></h3>



<p>Another security blunder to avoid is having information stolen from retired computers. Any equipment that housed personally identifiable information should be disposed of safely going through professional companies that offer services like <a href="https://datadestruction.com/certified-equipment-destruction/">Certified Equipment Destruction</a>.</p>



<h2>IT Support-Friendly Workstations</h2>



<p>There’s no way to make sure things run perfectly all the time. If they did, IT professionals would be out of a job. Yet in reality, they work every day to provide solutions to both common and uncommon workplace hitches. Giving them access to the appropriate tools helps increase a company’s productivity.</p>



<h3><strong>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure</strong></h3>



<p>VDI is a type of technology that lets users use an OS without having the actual OS on their computer.&nbsp; For example, a thief may break into an office and steal a laptop they think is full of valuable information. However, if the office runs a VDI through all their laptops, the thief is out of luck. There is no information on the laptop itself. It all gets projected from the VDI.</p>



<p>Additionally, a VDI uses a hypervisor to fix multiple IT issues at once. So, instead of the IT technician traveling to nine laptops separately to fix them, they can fix all nine from one centralized location. This means much less productivity is lost during the span of fixing those errors.</p>



<h3><strong>Allow IP Blocking</strong></h3>



<p>This one can be a touchy topic. Employees might feel like blocking certain websites can create too much of an overbearing environment. And sometimes, it’s hard to decide which websites might be needed for work. Giving the system administrator the ability to block sites is a great strategy that needs implementing. After all, they can track the sites used for work and adjust the blocking accordingly.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Ticketing Systems</strong></h3>



<p>Part of an IT support personnel’s workstation should include a ticketing system. Answering individual emails or Instant Messages (IMs) can cause a disorganized system for solving IT issues. A ticketing system can streamline the process and increase productivity.</p>



<h2>Return on Investment</h2>



<p>It might seem like a lot of trouble to implement so much for the sake of productivity. But each solution can prove to be a wise decision. Businesses thrive on productivity. Make sure your business computers are the best and most productive they can be.</p>

<h2>Factors to Consider When Buying a Projector</h2>



<p>Before you jump the gun and buy your very own gaming projector, know first the factors that you need to check. Don&#8217;t go in misinformed and check specs carefully so you will get the most out of your purchase.</p>



<h3>DLP VS LCD</h3>



<p>Know what better suits you as there are two kinds of projectors; DLP and LCD. DLP projectors use a light source along with a color wheel and a chip that includes some microscopic tilting mirrors. On the other hand, LCD projectors use a light source that passes light into 3 LCD Chips in order to project images</p>



<h3>Display Performance</h3>



<p>Of course, the most important factor is how good is its display. One important thing to check is color reproduction. Make sure that the color is accurate and sharp to ensure better rendering. Contrast ratio&nbsp;is also important as it supplements brightness and balances the picture. Pixel Density&nbsp;which is also known as display resolution is critical too.</p>



<h3>Brightness</h3>



<p>Make sure that light output is enough for optimum performance.&nbsp; Remember that poor light will result in muddy and soft display. Check the&nbsp;ANSI Lumens&nbsp;rating carefully.</p>



<h3>Portability</h3>



<p>Portability is important, not just for easy transport but for fuss-free installation as well.</p>



<h3>Inputs</h3>



<p>Before buying make sure that it supports the device that you are planning to hook it up to. To be on the safe side make sure to invest in a multi-platform projector to maximize its value.</p>



<h2>Wrap-Up</h2>



<p>Gaming is more enjoyable with better equipment. However, not everyone is blessed with deep pockets or the willingness to splurge. Then again, that doesn&#8217;t mean that low budgets mean low quality. Never settle for less and always be critical in the specs and features.</p>



<p>Make sure to read this guide and deliberate in what product resonates to your needs more. After all, there are loads of options out there if you know where to look.</p>

<p>all right so today we&#8217;re gonna review this beautiful keyboard it is it&#8217;s very interesting it&#8217;s a it&#8217;s one I found on Amazon I got it for Christmas it was nice to dad to receive I picked it because of the form factor and a few other things but I wanted to show you the box it comes in instructions it comes in kind of a weird box kind of a side evil the logo thing and a very random sticker throughout the packaging there&#8217;s a lot of Chinese so that may tell you a little bit about the origin let&#8217;s get in here let&#8217;s see if I can treat this thing like a monopod without dropping it so high probably one able to see it very well back there basically this is what we&#8217;re dealing with it actually looks pretty good right it&#8217;s got the the fun RGB thing everybody&#8217;s into these days but on so I don&#8217;t remember exactly what this form factor is called in terms of you see how it&#8217;s not the full ten keyless as I&#8217;m with the full-size right you&#8217;d have a over here you&#8217;d have the keypad thing but instead it&#8217;s like remove the keypad but still keep these keys that I personally use frequently home and page up page down and it likes a little teeth ring also delete I have that done so here it is and it looks good it&#8217;s not always stuck to that annoying rainbow pattern because who could get anything done looking at that all day also look at that look at that you go right there okay don&#8217;t don&#8217;t give up on me alright maybe we&#8217;ll cut that out maybe we&#8217;ll leave it in because it&#8217;s raw anyways so it comes with this awesome little user guide which I honestly had to break out again just because there&#8217;s there&#8217;s no there&#8217;s no real indication on how to change all the color stuff but it does have just have different lighting modes look at that you can plug in and play with this bad boy yeah so as you can see there&#8217;s there&#8217;s no indication that this comes with software you know I actually didn&#8217;t even look but I&#8217;m pretty sure that there&#8217;s no like onboard software that would control this same for you so here it is on Amazon I removed the price because I don&#8217;t know Amazon&#8217;s funny about affiliate stuff but I will link to this in the description so I would get a affiliate commission from that just to be fully transparent so if you buy it hey why not but if not no worries this is uh on Amazon&#8217;s title the e element Z 88 RGB mechanical keyboard blue switched out for the block so it comes with a few extra keys in here pretty standard and a key removal thing I won&#8217;t bother showing that because it&#8217;s it&#8217;s uh I mean it&#8217;s whatever not really showing so I will show you a few modes though because it&#8217;s cool it&#8217;s got um how do we do this function plus/minus to adjust the backlight color right seven different color options one weird thing that I noticed about this and I actually I will try and do this can I do this one hand maybe not function here we go so I&#8217;m also changing but basically it can go through so I can light up like that see you can do solid color I guess that was maybe a fading color or slightly pulsating I can&#8217;t even tell on the camera um you can do fun stuff whenever Easter colors this is for like if you push a key like pounds out from that whatever that&#8217;s called you got the RGB thing I guess that&#8217;s just nothing and then this is actually what I keep it at all the time it&#8217;s just solid green I also did that the mouse which I&#8217;ll do in another video but basically I do this hello green because greens awesome but also because if you do some of the other colors and I&#8217;ll try to do this real quick something like colors have like a trailing thing I don&#8217;t know how to explain it on a technical level I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a name for it but it&#8217;s basically where you like glance away real quick and out of the corner of your eye you can see that it&#8217;s not like the right refresh rate but you can see that it like trails I let&#8217;s see if the camera does it actually don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;ll work so to change colors what do we do function + &#8211; all right let&#8217;s go here function + + &#8211; I can see it on that one not that one okay let&#8217;s see which is the worst offender this is the worst offender I think this is supposed to be white I don&#8217;t know if the camera is picking that up this is really silly sorry for getting dizzy but um you can kind of see a trail yeah I think you can you can see a trail different colors like they&#8217;re not all refreshing at the same rate oh it&#8217;s it drives me crazy because normally I would put this at white but every time I glance up and down from the keyboard like up and down like you get that trail of color so that&#8217;s certainly something to watch out for with this keyboard but if you&#8217;re just doing like a different like solid blue green or red you&#8217;re probably gonna be ok with that weird nuance so like I said I just keep it green was the time I mean hey if I take it to a land party maybe I&#8217;ll I&#8217;ll rainbow it up or get the WASD thing going on yeah like I said I wanted this main the main feature of having this format in the keyboard the click Enis not bad it&#8217;s a little loud but they&#8217;re supposed to be blue style with that quotes there and I mean that&#8217;s that&#8217;s really about it it does have a nice removable you can you can see I&#8217;ve routed the cord through the desk here but it has a removable USB type not see you but being any or whatever I don&#8217;t know it plugs in there it comes undone that&#8217;s a nice feature I don&#8217;t think is I think special about the underside no you can see I&#8217;ll just take these off you can see the keys here I actually have a brown part on them so if you&#8217;re super into your mechanical keyboard and that means something to you other than sound then by all means that&#8217;s what it is got your other can use that are you know home surge play whatever have those little symbols it looks like they&#8217;re kind of lit up if you&#8217;re far back but I think that&#8217;s just thick the glare off of them they are not lit up they&#8217;re just painted on you also I guess you do have the brightness level indicators on these edges nice this I guess is maybe cycling through the colors anyways yeah you got Chinese you got English instructions if you&#8217;re looking for something it&#8217;s kind of compact still mechanically still kind of gamy and this is probably gonna be right up your alley so that being said thanks for watching and I really appreciate it link in the description to where you can get this product and also stay tuned because I&#8217;m going to be recording about this pretty sweet mouse over here right after this thanks guys</p>

<p>In case you want to read through the full transcript for the video, here you go:</p>



<p>all right so we are taking a look at the Roswell neon m59 so this is a pretty sweet gaming mouse ish I mean it can be a work mouse but it&#8217;s like a gaming style Mouse this guy DPI settings it&#8217;s got the RGB most importantly I enjoyed it I like it so I&#8217;m gonna bring you in for a closer look trying to do that okay so you may have seen in a previous video I just did on this awesome keyboard but today well now we are going to be focusing on this mouse which is pretty sweet looking and green I have to say about the mouse so I got this off Amazon I will link to that in the description below and full disclosure that will be an affiliate link to which I will get some sort of kickback so if you want to buy it through that that&#8217;s great if not that is okay as well so it&#8217;s got a pretty good reviews on here as you can see it&#8217;s got the RGB us like striping if you will this is the box that comes in it&#8217;s pretty standard except it&#8217;s it&#8217;s always interesting how you get a product offline and it looks like it&#8217;s meant to be on a show as far as I know it&#8217;s not a lot of Roosevelt products on shelves me me at a few computer stores that I left so I mean like I said standard stuff does have a nice braided cable which they advertise so I mean it feels really good you see the texture on there yeah that&#8217;s that so does come with a little instruction booklet which I actually had lost but you can always look this stuff up online too which I ended up doing so that being said let&#8217;s pull up the software that it comes with now if you saw the other video you&#8217;ll know that this thing does not come with software that being said I also love it so I will stop saying that being said we got um check it out you got steady you got color screaming I think that&#8217;s like the default and I set it to slow because I think that&#8217;s pretty cool you can see it does that nice striping no yeah it&#8217;s a little bit better so that&#8217;s that&#8217;s actually what I had it set to you for how long revenues almost two solid months now and that is because this software is only for Windows which makes sense you know I guess a lot of people use Windows I am personally a full-time Linux user unless it comes to gaming so but if by the off chance you are going to use this mouse under Linux you can change the settings here in Windows and they will it&#8217;s like it like writes it to the mouse or something I&#8217;m not entirely sure I&#8217;d be fun to figure out but those settings will carry over when you boot into Linux so I had it set to green to match the keyboard we also have like tail which it&#8217;s an interesting name for it I guess but it kind of just colors back and forth tailing tail at the color tails in because it&#8217;s not lit up constantly maybe that&#8217;s sort of saying you can do fast slow medium slow it would be interesting to check it out it&#8217;s pretty neat I always think the slow effects are better if you&#8217;re actually sitting and doing stuff oh cool so if you like this is if you click it&#8217;ll light up different colors um what else we got with the wave let&#8217;s try to wave the wave yep that is basically a tiny seizure don&#8217;t want that personally so yeah I am I just wanted a nice bright you set the brightness on it I just want it to match so I think it it looks pretty similar you know anyway so that is the the Roswell neon m59 I didn&#8217;t go into any of the DPI settings it&#8217;s pretty standard you can actually which I mean if you&#8217;re really into your sensitivity you can go in here and you can set the different level so like one this is you know one click then you click it again it&#8217;s level two click it again level three then it cycles through I just left him a default there pretty pretty fine they work in Linux as well um you can set all your speeds and portray down the why you&#8217;d want to go lower but again I&#8217;m not an uber pro gamer so you make use of that one thing that&#8217;s a fun to note is I did not pick its the macro you can set different macros in here could be seen as an unfair situation but it also could be awesome for productivity if you do a lot of clicky things with work stuff I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;ve never used mouse macros on a actual mouse setting level anyways guys thanks for watching hopefully you&#8217;ve enjoyed this small review on the mouse that I&#8217;m using currently and look forward to seeing you next time thanks for watching please hit subscribe if you liked this video</p>

<p>So I got a standing desk. As the title says, it was the SmartDesk 2 from Autonomous.</p>



<p>I have never owned a standing desk before, but I knew I wanted one after trying out standing and working on my laptop with different methods. It helps me focus more on the task at hand, and helps my body get a break from sitting all day (<a href="http://computerstationnation.com/desks/">not that I don&#8217;t love other awesome computer desks that you can view here</a>).</p>



<p>In a long roundabout way I found the SmartDesk 2 base and used my existing desk surface on it (probably will replace it later).</p>



<p>After using the desk for several months now, here is my review. The video is great, and the article provides even more detail.</p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>



<p>This thing was a breeze to put together. The instructions were very straight forward, I did not get lost when following them.</p>



<p>The only thing to note here is that this thing is super heavy, and you will need to turn it over a time or two. You may want a second set of hands to help, but was able to go it alone.</p>

<h2>Lifting Capacity</h2>



<p>This standing desk can lift 220 lbs! I laid on it and went up and down, and yes that was fun. This should be plenty of lift for your entire computer station.</p>



<p>Do note that the SmartDesk 2 &#8211; Business Edition has a lifting capacity of 300 lbs. This may come in handy if you are running giant CRT monitors still or something weird.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-smartdesk-2-motor.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-557" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-smartdesk-2-motor.jpg 800w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-smartdesk-2-motor-300x189.jpg 300w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-smartdesk-2-motor-768x484.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Stability</h2>



<p>The stability of this desk is great! I had previously looked at some standing desk that was on sale at Office Max and ready many reviews that the desk was not stable and it was very noticeable. Glad I avoided that.</p>



<p>The only time you notice a tiny bit of wobble is if you really shove the desk pretty hard, or when it is going up and down. Not a big deal for me since I am also going up and down with it.</p>



<h2>Noise</h2>



<p>This is not a silent desk by any means. There is an audible hum when adjusting the height of this desk. It does not bother me though.</p>



<p>It is a sound that a microphone would probably pick up, but then again so is the sound of the space heater that is next to me.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/epic-workstation-on-standing-desk.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-559" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/epic-workstation-on-standing-desk.jpg 800w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/epic-workstation-on-standing-desk-300x204.jpg 300w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/epic-workstation-on-standing-desk-768x522.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Adjustment Height Range</h2>



<p>The adjustment height range of the SmartDesk 2 is 29 inches &#8211; 47 inches. I am under 6 ft. tall, and I have no issues with how high it goes.</p>



<p>That being said, I do wish it went a little lower, just one or two inches to be flush with my arms.</p>



<p>The adjustment height range of the SmartDesk 2 &#8211; Business Edition is 24 inches to 51 inches. This could be a future upgrade.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-height-up.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-556" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-height-up.jpg 800w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-height-up-300x194.jpg 300w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-height-up-768x497.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Adjustment Height Speed</h2>



<p>The adjustment speed of SmartDesk 2 is 1 inch per second (compared to the Business Edition which is 2.3 inches per second). This speed is fine for me, I can take an extra second to stretch which I do any way.</p>



<h2>Controls</h2>



<p>The controls are pretty basic. You have 7 buttons on a panel that mounts under the desk. You can really place it any where you like. Instead of on the front I put mine off to the left side so it makes my desk look cleaner.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-controls.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-554" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-controls.jpg 800w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-controls-300x191.jpg 300w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/autonomous-standing-desk-controls-768x490.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>



<p>One button helps you save a height, 4 buttons that initiate a saved height, and two buttons to go up and down. Pretty easy!</p>



<h2>Warranty</h2>



<p>Warranty has never been much of a selling point for me, but it can be a, &#8220;nice to have&#8221; sort of thing. The warranty of the home edition is 1 year, but the business edition is 5 years.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Should you buy the Autonomous SmartDesk 2? Yes, but as with all things, it depends on your exact needs. <a href="http://computerstationnation.com/desks/types-of-standing-desks/">There are also other types of standing desks to consider</a>.</p>



<p>If you are looking for a way to get standing more at your computer station, then the SmartDesk 2 is a great way to do it without completely breaking the bank.</p>
