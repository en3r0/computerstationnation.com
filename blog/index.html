<div class="tempo-hentry">

    
    
<p>Want to buy a laptop but don’t know what to look for? Then, read our article. Here, you will find the top <strong>things to consider when buying a laptop</strong>, even if you don’t know the ABC of a laptop.</p>



<p>Buying a laptop is more hardened than purchasing a car. You can have a test drive and check the car before buying, but you can’t have a test run before buying a laptop. So, if you don’t have a clear idea of the laptop and it’s specifications, then it can be something like that you get what you don’t want.</p>



<p>However, in this content, we have to sum up almost all the things that you should know or check for before you buy it.</p>



<h2><strong>Things to Consider When Buying a Laptop</strong></h2>



<p>Before going to buy a laptop at first consider the fact that for what purpose you will use the laptop. Whether it’s for gaming, official use, or for general use. For different purposes, you will need different specifications. </p>



<p>So, here we have discussed all the considerations now whether you desire to buy for general use or gaming purpose doesn’t matter. Just read it and have definite ideas.</p>



<h3><strong>Look for a Good Brand</strong></h3>



<p>Before buying a laptop, at first, choose a good brand then look for the features in them. Because if you want the elements, then sometimes you can’t find the brand compatible with them. So, select the brand first, which one you prefer. </p>



<p>There is a wide range of brands you will get. But all of them are not highly preferable. If you want to use the apple software, then you can choose the MAC series. And if you want for gaming, then you can select Hp, Asus, Dell, Acer,  Lenovo with windows operating system. </p>



<p>Recently, Chromebook laptops have come with Google operating systems that are really being popular among some users. You can check for that also, but that will not be preferable for high-level gaming purposes.</p>



<p>Now let’s jump up to the specifications that you should look for when buying.<br></p>



<h3><strong>External Considerations</strong></h3>



<p>We are going to start with the external aspects. Here, you need to think about the monitor, keyboard features, and plugin options.</p>



<h4><strong> Screen: The First One You Need to Check</strong></h4>



<p>Well, it’s the first thing you should check. There are different types of display features you will find. The IPS(In Panel Switching) or even the display with OLED ( Organic Light Emitting Diode) display with 1920X1080 resolution is the best and improved one for HD resolution image/video support. </p>



<h4><strong>Size</strong></h4>



<p>If you think about the monitor size, then there are 11 inches to 17 inches, even 18-inch display available. But which one you should select it depends on how you are going to use it.</p>



<p> If you wish to carry it all the time, then try to choose between 13-15 inches, no need to buy the larger screen as it will lead to extra weight. And if you think your laptop is going to be stayed on your table all the time, then you can go for a 17/18 inch monitor for a good viewing option.</p>



<h4><strong>Display Type  </strong></h4>



<p>You will find two types of display- touchscreen or regular. As it’s an era of touchscreen devices, so everyone tends to search for a stylish, comfortable touchscreen display. But we recommend the typical screen for laptop because touchscreen display gets glossy and reflective. </p>



<p>Again, if you are buying the laptop for gaming purposes, then you should not choose the touchscreen one, somewhat standard display with high performing features. But if you need it for general use and want the style, not the performance, then you can choose the touchscreen.</p>



<h4><strong>Detachable/Foldable Laptop: Want Some Trendy Designs?</strong></h4>



<p>Nowadays, some laptops are available with detachable technology. You can fold the screen at a 180-degree angle and use the laptop as a tab. But it can cost you more and sometimes don’t give a high performance.</p>



<p>Again, Chromebook laptops have come with a technology that you can detach the screen from the keyboard part and use it as a tab. But it is going to be much expensive one.</p>



<h4><strong>Keyboard Features: Check Your Preferences</strong></h4>



<p>For the keyboard, you also need to think while you are going to use the laptop for gaming or general use. If you want it for high-performance gaming, then look for the </p>



<ul><li>Key travel of max 2 mm</li><li>backlight options</li></ul><p>and if you are using the device for general or official work, then no need to have the backlights on keyboards. It will consume more battery power.<br></p>



<h4><strong>Plug-In- Options: Need some exclusions?</strong></h4>



<p>For external connections such as- internet cable connections, external hard drive connecting, speaker connecting for better sound quality, or even other USB ports, you should choose 3.0 USB port. It can give better performance at high speed. </p>



<p>You can find even more, but that will cost more and no need for that also. Remember, the more ports can give you more connecting options.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Internal Considerations</strong></h3>



<p>Now external options are done, so let’s come in the internal-the main parts that will lead your operations. For internal components, you need to look for the CPU, the RAM, the GPU, the Cooler machine, Storage capacity, and the last one-the Battery. So let’s explore them.  </p>



<h4><strong>CPU: The Core Part</strong></h4>



<p>We all know that the CPU is the central core part of any computing device. So, among internal parts, at first, you need to check for the best CPU. </p>



<p>As the task of a CPU is to process data, so you need the best processor. For a good performing processor, you can go for intel core i-3, i-5, or i-7, respectively. Now some models of AMD bring a good quality processor. But if you need for gaming purpose, then go for Intel series, and general use, you can choose AMD latest series.</p>



<h4><strong>GPU Should Also Be Kept in Consideration</strong></h4>



<p>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is to control and look after the graphical units. As in a laptop, the CPU & GPU are coming as built-in options, and you can’t update them later so, you should choose the best one while buying.</p>



<p> If you think you have to work with a lot of graphical works or high performing games or video editing, then you should choose a better GPU of Nvidia or AMD series. If you don’t need a top-performing gaming or video editing works, then you don’t need to think much about GPU.<br></p>



<h4><strong>RAM for Working Speed</strong></h4>



<p>While you are checking for the things to consider when buying a laptop, you must check the RAM. You can find branded laptops having a RAM from 4GB to 64 GB also. But we recommend having at least 8 GB RAM. With that, you can do any tasks from entry-level to mid-level work and even work by opening many tabs or more than one software also.</p>



<p>But nowadays, people sometimes tend to have more RAM. But it can slow down your working performance and screen refreshing rate. So, 8 GB RAM is preferable, but with the less, you can do the general works like texting, mail checking, listening to music, and so on. With a RAM less than 8 GB, you can’t enjoy the taste of multitasking or even high-level modern games.</p>



<h4><strong>Storage Space</strong></h4>



<p>well, you need to check the storage capacities also. Now, there is a hard drive called SSD( Solid State Drive). With this hard drive, you can enjoy the full speed features. But note that SSD can cost you more.</p>



<p>If you can’t afford SSD, then you can go for the traditional HDD(Hard Drive Disk) with high storage capacities like- 1 TB can also be recommended. Also, you check the RPM( Revolutions Per Minute) of HDD and look for the 7200 RPM. It will give more speed.</p>



<p>Now Intel has brought a new technology HDD called-Intel Optane. You can buy it additionally and connect it to your laptop. It comes with 16 Gb/ 32 GB around. It’s for those who can’t afford SSD.<br></p>



<h4><strong>CPU Cooler:  Most People Forget About This</strong></h4>



<p>Well, CPU cooler comes as a built-in option on the laptops. So, many big branded companies forget about adding a good cooler. But if you are using your laptop for general use, then you don’t need a high performing liquid cooler. You can go with what the laptop has in-built.</p>



<p>But if you are using for gaming purposes, then you should check for a laptop with a high performing cooling device. </p>



<p>Oh if you also look for <a href="https://minitipsx.com/best-360mm-aio">360mm AIO cooler</a> for your another pc, you can check that link.<br></p>



<h4><strong>Battery Durability: The Last But Should Not Be The Least</strong></h4>



<p>As its a laptop, and you can use it as portable, so you should check for a battery giving long backup time. You should choose a laptop with a maximum of 8 to 10 hours of battery backup.</p>



<p>You should keep in mind that you have to consider 2 hours less than the given backup time. So, if there is written 10 hours backup, then consider it as 8, if 6 hrs then consider as 4 and so on.<br></p>



<p><strong>The Last One: Choose for The Upgradeable One</strong></p>



<p>Well, nowadays, laptop companies are making some laptops with upgradeable options. So if you can’t spend more now and want to upgrade later, then you can choose for the upgradeable one for further updating.</p>



<h2><strong>Final Words</strong></h2>



<p>The article is about almost all the things to consider when buying a laptop. By the end of reading this, you will surely have a clear idea about what to look for when you wish to buy a laptop. So, read it and purchase your desired laptop with our latest buying guidelines from complete research.</p>

<p>Many companies have gone digital, and it’s made for some pretty impressive increases in productivity. According to a Business Index run by Staples, three out of four workers feel they don’t have the latest technology. A similar survey found that people who used the newest technology felt they increased their productivity by 7 percent.</p>



<p>Finding the optimal configurations for business computers isn’t easy, but if you examine things like hardware, software, security systems, and even Information Technology (IT) workstations, you can find the right combination to increase productivity. First, let’s take a look at how you can configure hardware to increase it.</p>



<h2>Hardware</h2>



<p>Towers, monitors, keyboards, mice, and even headsets are vital components to your desktop. Using the right equipment is an easy way to make things much more user-friendly, which leads to easier access for the worker to get more done in less time.</p>



<h3><strong>Monitors: The More, The Merrier</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/computer-monitors-for-work/">Some jobs require just one monitor</a>, but have you ever considered a dual-monitor system for your workstation? If your job requires frequent multitasking and the use of multiple applications, dual monitors can be a lifesaver.</p>



<p>It’s been shown that using two monitors at the same time increases productivity 20-30 percent. That’s an astronomical number when it comes to producing more results. One of the reasons this occurs is because you have an entirely new monitor to open up documents on. It saves you a lot of time and money using this type of setup, and it’s worth the initial investment.</p>



<p>Different jobs will have different uses for the dual monitors, but a lot of it comes down to simply having more room to open up multiple applications at once.</p>



<h3><strong>Robust Processors</strong></h3>



<p>No one likes a slow Graphical User Interface (GUI). It’s even more frustrating when your applications freeze. A sluggish GUI means losing time – especially if it happens multiple times a day.</p>



<p>To alleviate this situation, you need to utilize powerful processors that help mold your workstation into the best business computer in the building. The minimum specifications for processors depend on the software you use and the nature of work done on the machine, so it’s best to research before buying one.</p>



<p>For example, the applications used by accountants, architects, and artists will perform their best-using processors in the three gigahertz (GHz) range. Other jobs may need more or less GHz depending on how powerful the applications are.</p>



<h3><strong>Graphics Cards</strong></h3>



<p>Using basic office applications and email doesn’t require a powerful graphics card. But if art, design, or videography are a big part of your business, it’s worth investing in decent ones. Since most software comes with a list of recommended specifications, it’s a good idea to research the apps you’ll use before you buy.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>Making sure you have the right software for the work being done is essential. Even your operating system (OS) can make or break productivity. There is no formula for crafting the perfect software, as every company is slightly different. Fortunately, you can tailor the software to your business’s needs.</p>



<h3><strong>Operating Systems: What You Need to Know</strong></h3>



<p>Implementing an OS that is compatible with the software you want to use is a priority. If it’s compatible, it should run smoothly. It’s also crucial to upgrade your OS so that it’s the most updated version available. </p>



<p>An outdated OS can lead to problems like hackers and other security breaches. And hackers slow down productivity. Finally, consider usability. An OS like Microsoft Windows is more well-known than Linux. Choose something that you know how to use, and it is easy for everyone to understand.</p>



<h3><strong>Personalized Software</strong></h3>



<p>Most businesses need basic software like a messaging system and writing applications. But specialized software that is helpful to the particular work being done can help productivity. For instance, utilizing Photoshop is an excellent idea if your company heavily deals with graphic design. </p>



<p>Downloading Photoshop on a business computer that specifically runs accounting software bogs down the computer with unnecessary baggage. Use your head and select the appropriate software.</p>



<h3><strong>Backup and Cloud Storage</strong></h3>



<p>Cloud storage is essential for files and data that could be lost otherwise. File recovery software also provides a good backup for accidentally deleted files. Nothing slows down productivity like having to re-do an entire day’s work.</p>



<h3><strong>Time Keeping Software</strong></h3>



<p>Time tracking software is another option that can have significant benefits for productivity. Knowing who’s working and how much time they’re putting in can help you track their productivity.</p>



<h2>Ergonomic Workstations</h2>



<p>Comfortable employees are productive employees. When typical office supplies like chairs don’t do their job correctly, it can halt productivity. This is due to several reasons, including workers feeling like they’re neglected and even physical issues with their backs and spines.</p>



<h3><strong>Desk Chairs: Worth the Money</strong></h3>



<p>If you have to get up and stretch or walk every ten minutes, odds are not a lot of work is getting done. Focus requires being comfortable enough to devote your attention to the task at hand. The second most common reason Americans visit the doctor’s office is lower back pain. That’s millions of Americans taking time out of their jobs to get their health checked. And, since they’re not at their job, they can’t be productive.</p>



<p>When looking for comfortable office chairs, make sure they’re adjustable. Raising and lowering them is vital since not everyone is the same size. It’s beneficial to have chairs with adjustable backs, as well. Some people are more comfortable when they can lean back. Others have medical conditions and sitting completely upright for too long can become painful. An ergonomic desk chair might seem like a luxury, but it’s more likely to save you money in the long run.</p>



<h3><strong>Ergonomic Desks</strong></h3>



<p>Hardware can be added to desks that allow monitors to be raised and lowered. Keyboard platforms often come with the same benefits. <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/desks/">Desks that can be adapted</a> to take the chair out of the equation are becoming more and more popular. They help reduce back pain and increase energy and productivity.</p>



<p>Whether <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/desks/types-of-standing-desks/">the desks for your computer are for sitting or standing</a>, making them versatile and accommodating for all types of users will help bolster a productive workplace.</p>



<h2>Security</h2>



<p>A security incident is a quick way to grind things to a halt. Proper security configurations implement the three A’s of security: authentication, authorization, and accounting.</p>



<h3><strong>Authentication</strong></h3>



<p>Everyone working in your company needs a way to authenticate themselves before accessing anything. All workstations should require identifying credentials before granting log-ins. </p>



<p>Passwords are also an essential step in the identification process. They create an extra level of security and accountability. Productivity for things like business computers relies on having a safe and secure work environment. Make sure your computers are safe.</p>



<h3><strong>Authorization</strong></h3>



<p>Should an employee in marketing be able to use their credentials to access company payroll information? Probably not. The authorization ensures users are only allowed access to areas they need to perform their tasks. </p>



<p>Authorization tools from companies like NextLab also take into consideration time and location. For example, users from an accounting department could be locked out of accessing accounting files after 7 pm. Or, an attempted email login from an unrecognized device could be blocked.</p>



<p>All of this creates an atmosphere for optimal productivity by keeping unauthorized users out of the system.</p>



<h3><strong>Firewalls</strong></h3>



<p>Network security is crucial for productivity. Malware sneaking onto your computer or a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack can throw a wrench into the workflow. Secure firewalls protect your company from many types of attacks, including the ones mentioned above.</p>



<h3><strong>Spam Filters</strong></h3>



<p>Phishing attacks are another avenue for malware to reach your workstation. Since they’re frequently found in emails, implementing a spam filter is an easy way to keep things more secure. </p>



<p>However, things occasionally slip through these filters. This is why it’s essential to educate employees on safety and security in the digital world. Informed users can recognize phishing attempts, even if the email server doesn’t.</p>



<h3><strong>Encryption</strong></h3>



<p>Data encryption is the best way to make sure only authorized eyes see such sensitive information. Even the smallest of businesses can benefit from using encryption software. When the only pair of eyes approved to see the information sees it, productivity goes much more smoothly.</p>



<h3><strong>Proper Disposal</strong></h3>



<p>Another security blunder to avoid is having information stolen from retired computers. Any equipment that housed personally identifiable information should be disposed of safely going through professional companies that offer services like <a href="https://datadestruction.com/certified-equipment-destruction/">Certified Equipment Destruction</a>.</p>



<h2>IT Support-Friendly Workstations</h2>



<p>There’s no way to make sure things run perfectly all the time. If they did, IT professionals would be out of a job. Yet in reality, they work every day to provide solutions to both common and uncommon workplace hitches. Giving them access to the appropriate tools helps increase a company’s productivity.</p>



<h3><strong>Virtual Desktop Infrastructure</strong></h3>



<p>VDI is a type of technology that lets users use an OS without having the actual OS on their computer.  For example, a thief may break into an office and steal a laptop they think is full of valuable information. However, if the office runs a VDI through all their laptops, the thief is out of luck. There is no information on the laptop itself. It all gets projected from the VDI.</p>



<p>Additionally, a VDI uses a hypervisor to fix multiple IT issues at once. So, instead of the IT technician traveling to nine laptops separately to fix them, they can fix all nine from one centralized location. This means much less productivity is lost during the span of fixing those errors.</p>



<h3><strong>Allow IP Blocking</strong></h3>



<p>This one can be a touchy topic. Employees might feel like blocking certain websites can create too much of an overbearing environment. And sometimes, it’s hard to decide which websites might be needed for work. Giving the system administrator the ability to block sites is a great strategy that needs implementing. After all, they can track the sites used for work and adjust the blocking accordingly.</p>



<h3><strong>Use Ticketing Systems</strong></h3>



<p>Part of an IT support personnel’s workstation should include a ticketing system. Answering individual emails or Instant Messages (IMs) can cause a disorganized system for solving IT issues. A ticketing system can streamline the process and increase productivity.</p>



<h2>Return on Investment</h2>



<p>It might seem like a lot of trouble to implement so much for the sake of productivity. But each solution can prove to be a wise decision. Businesses thrive on productivity. Make sure your business computers are the best and most productive they can be.</p>

<p>If you want to upgrade your gaming experience and decided to invest in a new projector, you are sure to meet a few hiccups. After all, though you want to level up your gaming station a tight budget is a party pooper.</p>

<p>Before you jump the gun and buy your very own gaming projector, know first the factors that you need to check. Don’t go in misinformed and check specs carefully so you will get the most out of your purchase.</p>



<h3>DLP VS LCD</h3>



<p>Know what better suits you as there are two kinds of projectors; DLP and LCD. DLP projectors use a light source along with a color wheel and a chip that includes some microscopic tilting mirrors. On the other hand, LCD projectors use a light source that passes light into 3 LCD Chips in order to project images</p>



<h3>Display Performance</h3>



<p>Of course, the most important factor is how good is its display. One important thing to check is color reproduction. Make sure that the color is accurate and sharp to ensure better rendering. Contrast ratio is also important as it supplements brightness and balances the picture. Pixel Density which is also known as display resolution is critical too.</p>



<h3>Brightness</h3>



<p>Make sure that light output is enough for optimum performance.  Remember that poor light will result in muddy and soft display. Check the ANSI Lumens rating carefully.</p>



<h3>Portability</h3>



<p>Portability is important, not just for easy transport but for fuss-free installation as well.</p>



<h3>Inputs</h3>



<p>Before buying make sure that it supports the device that you are planning to hook it up to. To be on the safe side make sure to invest in a multi-platform projector to maximize its value.</p>



<h2>Wrap-Up</h2>



<p>Gaming is more enjoyable with better equipment. However, not everyone is blessed with deep pockets or the willingness to splurge. Then again, that doesn’t mean that low budgets mean low quality. Never settle for less and always be critical in the specs and features.</p>



<p>Make sure to read this guide and deliberate in what product resonates to your needs more. After all, there are loads of options out there if you know where to look.</p>
