<p>A lot of times, we pay scant attention to the most important input device that holds our productivity in its hands; our keyboard.</p>



<p>What’s worse is the fact that it is a mechanical keyboard. I must confess that most time the way it is treated makes me want to be a “mechanical keyboard rights activist”!</p>



<p>Dear esteemed owner of <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/keyboards/">an awesome mechanical keyboard</a>, like every other piece of technology, it gets dirty as a result of constant use and other activities that might have caused delicious soda to spill on it. I’m sure you like the way it is functional and as a possession that serves you diligently, it should be properly cleaned from time to time to help it last longer and serve you better.</p>



<p>Here’s a guide on how to clean a mechanical keyboard.</p>



<h2>The Cleaning Process</h2>



<p>Most importantly, the type of cleaning process to indulge in is based on how often you clean your mechanical keyboard, as well as your reason for cleaning your mechanical keyboard in the first place.
