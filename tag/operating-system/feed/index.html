										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It can be annoying and this poses a difficult situation, when you have this file you want to transfer from your computer to your hard drive or from the hard drive to the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> and your hard drive doesn’t pop up.</p>



<p>This, of course, will hamper your productivity and delay you for a few minutes, sometimes for days, you can have this problem reoccurring. Many reasons can be reasonable for this issue and if not looked into properly, it is almost certain to reoccur after a while.</p>



<p>Here are a few solutions you can apply, to better the performance of your computer and to allow the easy exchange of information from your drive to your computer;</p>







<h2>Fixes That Are Recommended </h2>



<h3>1.Optimization</h3>



<p>Rightly so, optimize the computer and you can have the answers to the problem that has posed a challenge to you. Some settings are not just right, and this must have kicked your driver’s away from your system, unknown to you and so how do you fix this problem?</p>



<p>Simple, get a proven optimization software and optimize the computer. Ashampoo Win Optimize is our favorite optimization tool in this category, it offers in-depth cleaning and system optimization. You also get a diagnosis on the all-in-one intensive computer optimization spyware.</p>



<p>Start with optimization, and if the problem is not solved just yet, you need not worry we have some other great options you can try out.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Manually update your driver’s</strong></h3>



<p>The problem might be a driver that has broken down irretrievably, but it can be retrieved with a simple update. So get your hard drive recognized by the computer, by manually updating the drivers. What this implies is that the drivers can be updated in other ways, other than the manual update.</p>



<p>So for your manual update, click the Windows key + X to easily open the windows X menu and choose the device manager from the options on the window.</p>



<p>From Device manager, get to disk drive and expand it, if you find a yellow exclamation mark on the disk drive icon, it signals a driver issue and you are just on time to make that update happen.</p>



<p>The next step is to search automatically and make the update, this will surely open up your hard drive on the computer, but if the problem persists, we are in for a bigger role here.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Format your portable hard drive</strong></h3>



<p>This may be a hard one to do if you have loads of things saved up on the hard drive, but sometimes simple formatting is what you need to build that relationship between your windows 10 and then the hard drive. So risking this will not be a problem anyway.</p>



<p>How do you arrive at it? Simply follow the windows X keys and land at disk management again, when you are home here, right-click the hard drive and choose format hard drive if it shows here. </p>



<p>On achieving this feat, we believe you are good to go now, but if you are not, you need not worry we are together.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Run the hardware troubleshooter</strong></h3>



<p>Yes, you read this correctly. You might be wondering why we did not start it here since we have to troubleshoot every problem with the computer, trust me we have our reasons and we take each step with seasoned care. Therefore, we are here after all, and let&#8217;s see how this works.</p>



<p>Press the Windows key + 1, to open the Settings window, when you are here, head directly to the update and security section of the settings dialogue options. Click the Troubleshoot option from the button and follow the instructions therein, until you get your job done.</p>



<h3>5. <strong>Check the cable</strong></h3>



<p>I guess you never thought of this option, but here it is. As simple as this may look, it can be the course of the problem, which has made us try four different options before arriving at this end. Moreover, here might be the Promised Land after all.</p>



<p>It might be that your computer is not compatible with the cable your hard drive is using or the cable has stopped working and you do not know just here, here is what to do. </p>



<p>Try the cable on another system and see whether it pops up, if no, change the cable and try other cables if your answer here is a yes.</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Check the hard drive</strong></h3>



<p>Now that you have checked the cables, checking the hard drive if the problem persists, is an unavoidable conclusion and step you must take. </p>



<p>Here are a few basic things you must guarantee on the hard drive, first, ensure that the hard drive is turned on, secondly, connect it to a different port.</p>



<p>Your problem might be the port, lastly, connect the drive directly to the computer, do away with the USB hubs and get it directly connected.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Here are a few common issues of this kind that you are likely to experience when it comes to your external hard drive; </p>



<ul><li>External hard drive not showing up in disk management: it can be showing in other areas, but this one very important place, is where the external hard drive might fail to show.</li><li>You cannot access it in windows 10: you have recently upgraded to windows 10, and now your hard drive will not pop up, just the same way it has always done on your Windows 7 and 8.</li><li>Your USB Drive is not recognized; how do you work with your external hard drive when it cannot be recognized by your computer?</li></ul>



<p>These are common issues, you may encounter, and your issue may not fall into the categories mentioned above. However, the common thing here is that your external hard drive is not showing on your computer and this is the burden we seek to attend to and proffer lasting solutions to.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that we all run into issues with our hard drive now and then, utilizing any one of the options on this list will guarantee you success in your bid to get a lasting solution to the impasse of your card not showing up.</p>

<p>Settling for the Single Board Computer option may come as an easy choice as most people would likely want the nostalgia of playing retro games. Still, the rigor of setting up a retro console, which most times would require television and not forgetting the high antique cost of these consoles, maybe a little daunting for even the most enthusiastic gamer, hence the need to build a DIY console using the most adaptive hardware one can find.</p>



<p>Many development boards of the SBC variety are regularly used for retro gaming console emulation. However, a laptop and even a desktop often outperform these maker boards regardless of how advanced it may be.</p>



<p>This is because emulators are usually CPU bound and the majority of SBCs are unable to handle the emulation of newer gaming systems like the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Game Cube, and Wii. A lot of these development boards have been known to underperform when dealing with systems like Nintendo 64 and PlayStation Portable ROMs.</p>



<p>Although a GTX 1060, Ryzen 5 powered desktop can easily work on the Wii, PS 2, and sometimes the PS3 emulation a tad gracefully, this makes the Ryzen 5 somewhat of a sensation amongst users.</p>



<p>Regardless, single-board computers are cheaper and smaller hence they provide the best affordable entryway into the fascinating world of emulation. We have compiled a list of our best Single Board computers for Emulation to help you make the right choice for your emulation endeavors.</p>
