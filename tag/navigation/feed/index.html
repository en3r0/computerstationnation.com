<p>Here is the auto generated text from this video if you would rather read through that:</p>



<p>the time has come to show off the masterpiece I know it&#8217;s been a long time since the last video you can tell my face has grown long as they say and so is my hair I mean life happens things get busy but this machine&#8217;s been performing beautifully as you can see we got the the RGB strip down here in front cheapo knockoffs fans they don&#8217;t work or a sink that&#8217;s okay I&#8217;m not really concerned about that the only thing that kind of irks me a little bit is I have one RGB header which I put the strip on and so the case comes I you can&#8217;t see from this angle has a little bottom light in the front that works with the or a sink it&#8217;s just shining white because I had to unhook it to plug in the stripper fans of Linux and RGB may be a little disappointed because or sync does not have any native Linux clients there are some scripts out there I believe that people have created but it&#8217;s not quite the same so that stinks I&#8217;ll did I&#8217;ll live with it it&#8217;s fine one other thing is this thing is it does perform beautifully it I mean transfer speeds and everything is just so much faster than what I used to have I don&#8217;t have any benchmarks that I&#8217;ve run because quite frankly I haven&#8217;t had a lot of time and that&#8217;s why this videos late but you know I use it while I&#8217;m working from home every day you know maybe I&#8217;ll make a video on that soon a lot of people ask me how or do you like working from home yes it is awesome and you probably could find a job working from home if you really wanted to maybe there&#8217;s a lot of options out there but that&#8217;s for another video so in the meantime enjoy the beautiful footage [Music] alright guys thanks for watching I really do appreciate it yeah it&#8217;s been it&#8217;s been a lot of fun doing this it&#8217;s also been a good amount of work I apologize for the poor audio quality on something I know I need to fix so hopefully in that next video you you&#8217;ve got to subscribe to get it hopefully in that next video if you subscribe and get it I will have that audio fixed you&#8217;ll be able to hear me so much better so next time</p>
