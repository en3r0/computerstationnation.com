<p>Most phones now support wireless charging, but it is still faster and more affordable to charge using standard cables.

<p>Anker says this cable lasts more than 30 times longer than other cables. And since it&#8217;s extra long, you can charge your device far away from the outlet. The Anker PowerLine+ II series is durable and versatile, making it our top pick. Some cables, like Anker&#8217;s, come with dongles for multiple charger types.</p>



<p>The Anker PowerLine+ II series offers excellent durability and fast charging speeds, making it easily the best standard charging cable out there.</p>



<p>Anker has long made some of the better cables on the market, and the Anker PowerLine+ II series of charging cables are the best out there. Many factors make the Anker PowerLine+ II cables so great. Perhaps the best feature, however, is the fact that they&#8217;re extremely durable. The cables are built with braided nylon covering, ensuring that no matter how much you bend and stretch the cables, they won&#8217;t break. That&#8217;s in stark contrast to normal charging cables.</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s any downside to the Anker PowerLine+ II series, it&#8217;s the fact that they only support data transfer speeds of USB 2.0, or 480 Megabits per second (Mbps). Still, considering you&#8217;re likely buying the cables for charging, and not for data connectivity, that won&#8217;t matter to most. They&#8217;re also a little expensive compared to many other charging cables, and there&#8217;s no USB-C to USB-C model – though there is one in the even more expensive PowerLine+ III series.</p>



<p>Despite the downsides, the vast majority of users love the Anker PowerLine+ II series of cables. Anker are indeed stronger than the average cable and certainly lasted longer than the cables that probably come with your phone. The fact that they&#8217;re available in a range of models is a bonus, even if you don&#8217;t necessarily need all of those models.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Durable.</li><li>Available in a range of colors.</li><li>Fast charging speed.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>2.0 only</li><li>Expensive</li></ul>

<p>The 10-foot Native Union Night cable makes charging your iPhone super easy when you need a long, strong, stable lightning cable. The Native Union Night Cable offers a long 10-foot design, plus it&#8217;s durable and offers a weighted design to help keep your devices safe.</p>



<p>Sometimes you need a little more from your charging cables. Perhaps you want one plugged in near the couch that you can use while watching TV. Or, you want one near your home desk. Whatever the reason, if you want a longer charging cable, it&#8217;s worth considering Native Union&#8217;s 10-foot charging cables, which are available in a range of different types.</p>



<p>Like the Anker PowerLine+ II cables, Native Union&#8217;s cables have braided nylon covering – helping ensure that they don&#8217;t break. That&#8217;s even more useful for longer cables since you&#8217;ll likely be pulling on them and twisting them more. The Native Union Night Cable supports charging speeds of up to 2.4 amps.</p>



<p>This particular cable has an extra design feature to help keep your devices safe – a weighted knot. Users can slide the knot up or down the cable to find the perfect position for the weight. It looks a little strange – like the cord is massively tangled – but is useful. It helps ensure that the cable doesn&#8217;t pull your phone off the table, which is a smart touch. Native Union stands behind its cables too. The company offers a lifetime warranty to cover any material defects.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Durable.</li><li>Weighted design.</li><li>The leather strap keeps the cable neatly tied up.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Cable tidy belt feels flimsy</li></ul>

<p>The Fuse Chicken Titan is literally made from stainless steel – and as a result, even your dog won&#8217;t be able to chew its way through the cable. Always seem to break your charging cable, or want to make sure that your pet can&#8217;t chew through the cable? The Fuse Chicken Titan cable is the way to go. This cable swaps out the braided nylon covering for a stainless steel one, ensuring that the cable will never break.</p>



<p>The Titan is unfortunately really only available in a Lightning model, however ,the company does sell an ultra-strong USB-C cable as well. That cable isn&#8217;t made from metal, but it should still last longer than most. The Titan is rugged, thick, and heavy. That makes it perfect for those looking for an ultra-durable cable, but less appealing for anyone trying to carry it around. It flexes and bends nicely, but still takes up more space than a traditional cable.</p>



<p>The Titan comes in at 3.3 feet, or 1 meter, which is fine for most users but will be a little short for others. Despite that, however, we think the Fuse Chicken cable is one of the best out there, thanks to its layers of flexible steel.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Extremely durable.</li><li>MFi certified.</li><li>Lifetime warranty.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Expensive</li><li>A little short</li></ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Before you buy, you&#8217;ll want to consider the type of cables that you actually need. If you want to charge your iPhone, you&#8217;ll need a Lightning cable. Most Android devices and certain iPad models like the iPad Pro and the latest iPad Air use the USB-C standard. Other devices, like headphones, will use MicroUSB.</p>



<p>Some people might need only one of the units from this list to meet all their charging needs, while others who are always on the move might be wise to grab two or even three of the chargers to cover their bases.
