<p>Minecraft games are loved for a dozen reasons. The first on the list is that the games can increase one&#8217;s creativity or better still, put one&#8217;s creativity into action as you are made to build lavish, and gorgeous houses with limited resources.</p>



<p>Secondly, it promotes teamwork. As students and players often collaborate to achieve goals and the superb multiplayer option that allows a team to build and fight together, furthermore, families can set up their dedicated server and work their way to the top.</p>



<p>Lastly, Minecraft games improve one&#8217;s problem-solving skills, with their resource management ideas and needs. Getting a computer that smoothly runs Minecraft can be a challenge, noting that this game has always been on desktop.</p>



<p>Yet, there are computers other than a desktop that will do a beautiful job for you, and in this list; we will be reviewing such computers and their suitability for Minecraft games. Just before that, let&#8217;s look at the essential requirements; such computers must have to run Minecraft.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>CPU: the CPU is one of the essential components to be considered in the choice of computer for Minecraft, while Minecraft runs on one core. A computer’s speed will still determine how fast Minecraft loads.</li><li>GPU and RAM: Just like the CPU, the GPU and RAM are equally essential. You will need a dedicated GPU card, as well as a good amount of RAM to avoid lags and below-par displays.</li><li>Storage: Minecraft games are usually not storage-intensive, however, the shaders and Mods that have made the games easy to play, can occupy just enough space on your computer.</li></ol>



<p>Our list of top three computers for Minecraft covers these essential requirements and many other features of a computer that makes it frame rate for Minecraft. Our picks are not Minecraft playable computers alone, but best fitted and compatible computers for Minecraft.</p>



<p>So let us look at the list</p>

<p>Computer Word Games are gaining popularity, and it has unquestionably earned itself some high marks as a source of entertainment, education, and stress relief. As opposed to video games, there are numerous reasons people of all ages and gender favor computer games, which includes improvement in cognitive abilities, vocabulary, and concentration. </p>



<p>Word games are also an effective tool for improving problem-solving skills and creating an educative platform for socialization.</p>



<p>Numerous word games can be played on your computer, and you must identify with the best games that can help you relieve stress and improve your mental focus and vocabulary at the same time. </p>

<h2>Wordament</h2>



<p>Having millions of players that you can play against in real-time, Wordament has earned itself some fine credits as one of the most popular and well-played computer word games. </p>



<p>It is available on Windows 10 PC and mobile app for free with sponsored ads. However, if you find the ads distracting and want to play the game without ads, you can subscribe to a premium package.</p>



<p>Wordament employs a time duration of two minutes within which the player is expected to create words by connecting them either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically. </p>



<p>The player is provided with the options for shuffle and hints, after which he will be scored according to the number of words he was able to form and the duration that it took to complete the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://wordament-windows-10.en.softonic.com/"><strong>Download Wordament for Windows 10</strong></a></p>



<h2>TypeShift</h2>



<p>Unlike the Wordament, where you’re expected to connect words either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, TypeShift requires its players to form words by moving a cell that contains a single letter to a row till the correct word is formed. </p>



<p>The wrong spelling of a word is displayed, and the player is expected to form the correct word by moving any letter from the alphabets provided till he forms the correct word, and the game ends when you find all the correct words.</p>



<p>At the beginner’s level, this game is straightforward and fun to play, but as you progress, it becomes complex and requires in-depth knowledge of vocabularies to maintain your grades.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.typeshift"><strong>Download Typeshift for Android</strong></a></p>



<h2>Words With Friends 2</h2>



<p>Like its name, it is designed to be played online with friends who you’re expected to win with more points in different sections of the games; plus, it provides options that allow you to track your game progress easily.</p>



<p>Apart from a multiplayer setting, this game also has a solo challenge where you can either play single-handedly or compete against fictional characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Words with Friends 2 have earned its popularity in its gaming manifesto that requires in-depth strategic thinking, wide knowledge of vocabularies, speed, and accuracy. </p>



<p>In addition to this, a rank is bestowed on each avid player based on his gaming prowess, and each updated version of the game makes it fun, entertaining, and educative to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next big question that plagues the mind of every gamer is knowing what Operating System can efficiently satisfy their gaming appetites.

<h2>DirectX12 Interface </h2>



<p>The Windows 10 operating system also employs an Application programming Interface known as DirectX 12 that employs features that allow you to add graphic effects to your games and also improve the performance of some games that use a similar graphics card.</p>



<h2>Parting Tips </h2>



<p>Windows 10 operating system owns the crown with respect to games. It is the best operating system if you’re looking for functionality, versatility, and convenience, for a thrilling and satisfactory gaming experience. </p>
