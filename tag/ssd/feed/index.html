<p>SSD’s are well known for their speed and enhanced performance of the operating system and the applications installed on the computer but it is not all rosy especially with its storage capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite their outstanding speed, they are not an ideal storage location for files because of their poor storage capacity which gets full in no time and thus leading to the very same thing that you’ve been avoiding all along – slow performance.</p>



<p>To sustain the speed of your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer&#8217;s</a> SSD, you need to pair it with an HDD. HDDs are excellent storage devices that support heavy-duty files in large volumes. They are easily affordable and function excellently with an SSD in a computer as an alternative storage device for your files.</p>







<h2>Moving Files From SSD to HDD</h2>



<p>There are different ways that you employ to move files from SSD to HDD and they include</p>



<h2>Dragging</h2>



<p>Selecting and dragging them from their previous location on the SSD and dropping them on a new location saved on the HDD</p>



<h2>Copy and Paste</h2>



<p>Copying the files from the previous location on SSD and pasting them in a new location on the HDD can be done by right clicking on the desired file that wants to be moved, activating the copy option, creating a folder on the new location, and pasting it there. The files saved on the previous SSD location have to be deleted to avoid having duplicate files so that the computer can recognize a single file.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>When transferring a large number of files at the same time, it is advisable to use a software application that supports the moving of files to a new hard drive. This software allows the quick moving of large files to different locations in the computer. This feature is sustained by its strong compatibility with windows and different storage devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, create a folder on your chosen software. Choose a new storage location for saving the files ( HDD) and save the files. The files and subsequent ones will be automatically saved on the new storage location which is the HDD.</p>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The copy and paste, and then drag and drop features are only suitable for moving a small number of files. In other words, when moving a large amount of files, they should be moved in bits moved through a software after the HDD has been set to an NTFS format.</p>

<p>There are very few 4TB NVMe SSDs on the market today and none are faster than this model. If you want the fastest 4TB M.2 2280 NVMe SSD on the market you can stop looking. </p>



<p>The Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus is the highest capacity SSD available today that can reach performance highs of 7GB/s. It comes with a decent price point and 1yr standard with the option to register and increase the warranty to 5-years.</p>



<p>Powered by Phison PS5018-E18 PCIe 4.0 x4 NVMe SSD controller and Micron’s 96L TLC flash, the Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus boast some serious hardware that enables it to shatter write speed records. </p>



<p>Not only is it fast, with its black PCB and matching black PCB and copper tone heat spreader, but it’s also a very attractive M.2. At prices that undercut both several others it’s a great value for those looking to save some cash, but still, get that responsive PCIe 4.0 performance.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Fast sequential performance</li><li>Competitive pricing</li><li>Attractive design</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Not quite as responsive or efficient as WD</li><li>No AES 256-bit encryption</li></ul>

<p>The Black SN850 is WD&#8217;s first NVMe drive to support the new super-fast PCIe Gen 4 standard, and goodness what a way to make an entrance. Not only does it offer significantly faster write speeds than any in its range at the moment, but it&#8217;s cheaper, too. </p>



<p>Not by much, all told, and certainly not enough to take the sting out of buying a PCIe 4.0 SSD in general, but when you stack them up side by side with any other in its range, the WD Black SN850 is the clear winner here.</p>



<p>The Western Digital Black SN850 makes a fashionably late entrance to the PCIe 4.0 party. It&#8217;s capable of hitting 7,000MB/s reads and 5,300MB/s writes in sequential transfers, which is well beyond the other drives&#8217; capabilities. That&#8217;s because it uses the latest PCIe 4.0 interface, which has double the theoretical bandwidth limit of the other PCIe 3.0 drives.</p>



<p>Its performance ultimately defines any SSD; the WD SN850 really stands out from the crowd. The synthetic benchmarks, spearheaded by ATTO and AS SSD, show that this is very much a second-generation PCIe 4.0 drive, with peak sequential read speeds knocking on 6,750MB/s and 5,920MB/s, respectively. Writes are lower than the Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus, but still healthy, at either side of 5GB/s.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Impressive speed</li><li>Blistering PCIe 4.0 throughput</li><li>Excellent real-world performance</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Runs hot</li><li>Quite expensive</li></ul>

<p>Western Digital&#8217;s entry into the SSD arena was a long while coming, especially at the speedier end of the market, but the WD Black SN750 was arguably worth the wait. It nails solid-state performance on par with the best consumer Samsung EVO SSDs and severely undercuts them on price.</p>



<p>The combination of an in-house memory controller and Toshiba memory (also essentially in-house after the acquisition of the SanDisk/Toshiba memory division) means what we&#8217;ve got here is a drive that can match Samsung in its build methodology too. And that all means WD can be very aggressive on how much it charges people for the privilege of having a speedy PCIe SSD in their gaming PC.</p>



<p>There is a more expensive version on offer with a heatsink attached to it. Still, so long as you don&#8217;t bury your drive in an M.2 slot beneath your GPU, you should be golden, and the SN750 will maintain peak performance without burning out and without any extra SSD cooling.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Competitive pricing</li><li>Serious SSD performance</li><li>In-house technology</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Could use a few more firmware optimizations</li><li>Big premium for heatsink</li></ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Considering the huge install sizes of modern games, only rising, having the best SSD for gaming is an increasingly crucial part of any modern gaming PC builds. The HDD vs. SSD storage war isn&#8217;t necessarily over, but we couldn&#8217;t recommend an old spinning platter as the main drive in your gaming PC.</p>



<p>At one point, having a small SSD as a boot drive was a luxury. Now, at the advent of 4K and next-gen gaming, if you want to play your games at the highest speeds possible, investing in a quality SSD is your best bet. It should help you to defend against the incoming storage onslaught.</p>



<p>Finding the best SSD or solid-state drive for your needs is important if you want the best gaming PC or laptop, or you just want a snappy productivity machine. </p>



<p>A slow storage drive makes for a big bottleneck, forcing your processor (even if it&#8217;s one of the best CPUs) to sit there twiddling its clock cycles, waiting for data. </p>



<p>Our pick of the best SSDs range from 1TB to as far as 4TB drives because smaller SSDs, though cheaper, lose performance. And, with games such as Red Dead Redemption 2, Destiny 2, and Modern Warfare taking up well over 150GB each, you need a lot of storage space these days to avoid a whole lot of inventory management.</p>



<p>Finally, we strongly recommend the WD Black SN850 1TB NVMe SSD even if the WD Black SN850&#8217;s game load times aren&#8217;t quite as lightning fast as its transfer speeds or random read and write times, this is still an exceptional SSD that&#8217;s leaps and bounds ahead of its current competition. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not only the best NVMe drive you&#8217;ll get for its price range which offer the kind of performance, speed, and value for your money delivery you&#8217;re looking for but it has also managed to outpace the Sabrent drive, hence why it replaced it on this list.
