										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Listen, we have all sat in a bad office chair and you don&#8217;t have to pretend the one you are sitting in now is without issues.</p>



<p><a href="https://computerstationnation.com/chairs/">A good office chair</a> helps you to stay comfortable when working. It provides a soft surface to sit on, arm rests, lumbar support and enough adjustability to guarantee your well being throughout the day. An office chair is a very important part of your furniture! Unfortunately, it can develop problems due to many years of use, damage or error during the manufacturing process. Here are some office chair problems and how you can solve them.</p>







<h2>Weak or worn out chair cushion</h2>



<p>The seat cushion is one of the most important parts of your office chair because it provides a pliable surface for you to sit on while working. There are many office chairs that are equipped with visually attractive chair cushions upholstered in glistening faux leather. They look plump, soft and durable but do not hold up well after long hours of usage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may find that the seat cushion stays compressed even after you stand up from it. If you notice that a seat cushion stays compressed after you stand up, it is likely that it will get worn out quickly after repeated usage. In situations of extreme damage, you may find that your office chair leans to one side because of an improperly fitted seat cushion.</p>



<p>The best way to avoid problems arising from office chair seat cushions is to pick a proper one during purchase. There are some strategies that you can rely on to select a good quality office chair at the furniture store. Kneel upon an edge of the seat cushion and if you don&#8217;t feel the metal frame underneath, that specific chair will last for a long time. You can also sit on it and stand up immediately. If the seat cushion regains firmness immediately, the office chair will maintain comfort for a long time. If you already have an office chair with a weak or worn out chair cushion, you can have it re-upholstered at a furniture store or automotive tuning shop.</p>



<h2>Sinking chair</h2>



<p>Do you usually feel as though the office chair is sinking slowly when you&#8217;re sitting in it? If you experience this problem, the culprit is its gas cylinder system. Also known as the gas lift or pneumatic cylinder, it is a common issue that arises with many office chairs. If this system ceases to operate as required, the pressure monitoring mechanism has failed. When this happens, you need to contact the chair&#8217;s manufacturer to request a replacement. Relying on its warranty is always a great strategy to fix this problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your office chair&#8217;s gas cylinder can start to malfunction if you exceed its weight rating. Majority of chairs have a rating of 225 pounds and if you tip the scales more than that, the gas cylinder system will experience challenges supporting your weight resulting in a sinking feeling during use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continual usage for many years can also affect the pneumatic system of your office chair in a negative way. If you use the chair for more than 10 years, its gas cylinder system will gradually begin to fail and sink whenever you are seated. If you feel the chair sinking after having used it for a decade or more, it is time for a replacement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Cracked or worn out castors </h2>



<p>Did you know that the standard castors on office chairs were developed for use on low-pile carpeting? As a matter of fact, office chair manufacturers insist that you utilize a chair mat for smooth movement that will not damage your floor. Standard castors are made of hardened plastic set over a steel frame. If your office has tiles, hardwood or laminate, always use a chair mat. Otherwise, the castors will scratch your floor and disfigure it.</p>



<p>After months of improper usage, the castors can crack or become unevenly worn out causing you to wonder why the office chair won&#8217;t stay up. When you&#8217;ve got worn out or damaged castors, have them replaced by a qualified office furniture technician. They can fit special castors which have rubberized edges that are designed for use on hard floors. Such castors will operate on a hard floor without damaging it and promote your comfort at the same time!</p>



<h2>Faulty recliner</h2>



<p>The latest office chair models are designed to recline on demand. By using a lever or set of buttons, you can make the backrest recline at angles ranging from 100 degrees to 180 degrees. In essence, your chair can recline until it lies flat like a bed. By using the recliner mechanism, you can control your level of comfort when using the chair. This gives you a chance to take a break and relax in-between your working hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the recliner mechanism is awesome, it can cease to operate as would be expected. The backrest can move erratically while reclining instead of shifting smoothly. Even worse, the recliner cogs can get stuck making the system completely inoperable. In an extreme case, the backrest can simply fail to maintain an optimum angle and fall back flat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you are faced with such a problem, a suitable solution is to consult the manufacturer. They will replace the reclining mechanism at no cost to you as long as your warranty is still valid. If the system fails after your warranty has already expired, a carpentry technician can help to repair it with the objective of restoring proper functionality.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Studies have shown that your level of comfort actively affects your productivity. With this in mind, it is essential to invest in an office chair that supports your back, shoulders and seat using the best materials available today. It should provide arm rests and the mechanisms necessary for multiple adjustments.</p>



<p>Many of our office chairs start out with brilliant performance but begin to get plagued by malfunction during use. We have covered some office chair problems above for you. Not only are they irritating, these issues can prove detrimental to your wellness. Thankfully, we have also suggested solutions to fix these problems. Follow our guidelines as you invest in an office chair to experience fulfillment every time you go to work!</p>

<h2>Why You Might Want An Executive Office Chair</h2>



<p>When I was much younger, I asked my dad why he favored executive chairs to other regular office chairs. He said that there are two kinds of chairs; an executive office chair and others. He refused to give the “others” a name. Because to him, a chair that doesn’t speak about prestige and command power the way an executive chair does, has no business being in your office &#8211; especially if you’re the boss or you are nursing such an aspiration.</p>



<p>He refers to executive chairs as thrones of organizational power.&nbsp; Having grown up and worked in different organizations that brought together different kinds of people, I don’t think my dad was far from the truth, though I also learned more things that were quite different, they had one thing in common about executive chairs and that is authority.</p>



<p>I know you might be wondering why I think so highly of executive chairs but being synonymous with power, but it can also be a tough task picking the one that is right for you. A high-end executive chair should align with your body to provide the optimum result that you desire because employing your best assets and time for the best results should make you feel powerful.</p>

<p>Attached to all these powerful and fully-in-control features is a tension knob that adjusts the resistance when reclining in a way that makes it looser or tighter depending on how you want this feature to be utilized. A plus feature that comes with this chair is its synchro mechanism that is capable of reclining both the seat and backrest but at a low medium of 1:2 ratio. This helps to minimize the way the seat reclines when compared to the backrest. This technological placement on the chair helps to prevent the rocking chair effect and helps your feet maintain balance on the ground while still increasing blood circulation and better spinal alignment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We start our discussion with a feature-packed set, best suited for smaller office spaces and a restricted workforce. This executive office furniture set from Bestar boasts of excellent manufacturing materials, including the commercial-grade laminate and high-density P2 board. The melamine finish further adds to the aesthetic credibility of this office suite.</p>



<p>The structural brilliance continues with the 1-inch thick working surface and the brushed handles carved out of nickel. When it comes to storage, this is one of the few executive office furniture suites to stack in a utility drawer, hutch, multiple shelves, file cabinet, and a dedicated bookcase. The workplace where you accommodate the monitor also features a sliding channel for the keyboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this product excels in the cable management department courtesy of the intuitive grommet bridge which is reversible in nature. Moreover, you can also choose the U-shaped variant of this furniture set to accommodate an additional professional into the mix. Besides offering a workstation that is stain-proof, immune to wear and tear, and scratch-resistant, the company sweetens the pot further with an ergonomic chair. The height-adjustable sitting option also features sturdy armrests and innovative lumbar support.</p>

The best thing about this luxury executive office furniture set is that it translates to a corner desk with a maximum working space of almost 48 inches. The company also allows you to pair accessory task lights with the product.</p>



<p>Some of the more standout attributes include the availability of self-closing storage units and hinges clubbed with the availability of other storage units and smaller cabinets. This product brings forth two shelves that are fixed and four adjustable units, making way for concealed storage support. Last but not least, the cubicle office set also comes with decent cable management support.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Extremely durable with scratch-proof laminate</li><li>Inclusion of six storage shelves; two fixed and four adjustable</li><li>Self-closing, innovative hinges add to the productivity of this furniture set</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The installation process is extremely time-consuming&nbsp;</li><li>Doesn’t support standalone usage</li></ul>

<p>Editors’ Rating- 4.5 out of 5</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>While these are some of the best executive office furniture suites in the market, you must ascertain the requirements before making the purchase. Despite each product having its utility, we would personally recommend the L-shaped or U-Shaped suite from Bush furniture, provided you are looking to set up an expansive corporate establishment.</p>



<p>For better demarcation, the cubicle series is the best possible choice. However, if you are only looking for a compact space with an ergonomic chair and dedicated storage units, the standalone and affordable product from Bestar is the one to go with.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t like any of these three options, feel free to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=computersta08-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=19641f20736026d150518dbf1f9f95a4&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;index=aps&amp;keywords=Executive Office Furniture Set">continue browsing</a> over on Amazon.</p>

<h2>3. Vibrant</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gxeumf/finally_got_a_monitor_and_keyboard/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Finally got a monitor and keyboard!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>All those years of working at the office might have bored you of the dull color schemes. This home workplace setup makes use of table lamps to create a vibrant color scheme that will make you look forward to starting work every day.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>4. Sweet and simple</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://preview.redd.it/rqpso4rhuq251.jpg?width=640&#038;crop=smart&#038;auto=webp&#038;s=edaa629377e8bd7be83a6fcb59931d42329469f2\
</div></figure>



<p>Another work-from-home setup that does not require massive investment, but ends up getting the job done. Even after placing the monitor, keyboard, and speakers, there is plenty of space to make sure that you do not feel cluttered or bogged-down.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>5. Calm and quiet</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gvrxgb/new_podcasting_set_up/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">New podcasting set up</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With a peaceful background and no noise of any sort, such a home office setup is particularly useful for people who record content such as music or podcasts. The daylight seeping in through the window will help you stimulate your creative juices.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>6. Working with views</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gug4l5/pretty_much_my_dream_setup_views_standing_desk/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Pretty much my dream setup&#8230; Views ✅. Standing desk ✅. Triple Monitors ✅.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This setup allows you to keep in touch with the outside world through the vivid views that it offers. However, if, at times, you feel uncomfortable with people staring at you, you can always shut the half-transparent blinds. Particularly useful for people who like standing up and moving around when they are feeling restless while working.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>7. Funky</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gufd85/needs_improvement_but_my_first_time_cable/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Needs improvement but my first time cable managing and putting everything together didn’t go horrendously!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Some people enjoy working under funky surroundings &#8211; it gives them a sort of inexplicable motivation. This home office design allows you to set up multiple monitors, all under those fancy lights that enable you to enjoy &#8211; and not turn bored with &#8211; your work.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>8. Minimalist setup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gs4ij9/obligatory_photo_of_my_minimalist_work_space/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">obligatory photo of my minimalist work space. Unfortunately its really hard to get good lighting here.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A very clean and functional setup, using a USB-C dock velcroed to the bottom of the desk to connect the multiple monitors. A beneficial structure if you are someone who enjoys working without too much light coming in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>9. One-cable setup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gz968r/not_your_ideal_onecable_setup_but_i_love_it/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Not your ideal one-cable setup, but I LOVE it!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Another kind of setup for people who wish to work without too much light seeping into the room. With the light coming from an electric candle and through the shades, this setup will make sure that you still have enough light to keep you working without hurting your eyes or head.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>10. Working from home is fun</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gwdcxt/working_from_home_here_isnt_half_bad/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Working from home here isn&#8217;t half bad</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>&nbsp;A setup which is ideal for people who work with music and musical instruments. The desk is the IKEA Barkaboda kitchen countertop, on autonomous standing legs. The guitar is from Gibson, while the speakers are Yamaha HS8, connected to a Soundrise pro monitor.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>11. Unfancy but effective</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gzex1g/changed_up_my_workplace_a_bit_during_covid_boredom/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Changed up my workplace a bit during covid boredom.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>If you want to give your home workspace a bit of shakeup without spending too much time or money, this is one of the best ideas for you. Cleaning up your table and getting a new keyboard or a tiny table clock can go a long way in restructuring and improving your mood and attitude.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>12. Clean is not for everyone</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gyttk8/my_finally_organized_study_space_im_a_visual/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My finally organized study space&#8211; I&#8217;m a visual person that likes to be able to see everything in its place.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Even though there are numerous people who prefer their home workspace neat and organized. However, others feel that being surrounded by work papers and other materials stimulates their productivity. This home office setup is a homage to the latter kind of workers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>13. Healthy working</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gyopsn/starting_to_come_together_just_waiting_on_a/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">starting to come together, just waiting on a back-ordered uplift desk and vertical laptop stands.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It is extremely important that, while working those long hours, you take care of your health and body. The huge LED monitor ensures that you do not damage your eyes by concentrating too hard, while the Steelcase Gesture chair allows you to keep a relaxed posture that your back will thank you for.</p>



<h2>14. Keep it simple</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gxtp9g/old_and_new/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Old and new</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This setup is another example of how you do not need to do anything fancy to get a working space which is effective yet aesthetic. A Hague Blue wall color by Farrow and Ball, an ‘Everything is fine’ art piece, and a spotlessly clean floor, come together to create an enviable home working area.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>15. A shelf that makes a statement</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gx2j11/new_office_view/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">New office view!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With a desk that houses all your essential work equipment &#8211; including a laptop, printer, and telephone &#8211; and a shelf that portrays your favorite photographs and other family memorabilia, this setup is an ideal combination of work plus sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>16. Combining work and play</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gurpd0/my_workspace_in_toulouse_france_closeups_in_first/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My Workspace in Toulouse, France. (Close-ups in first comment)</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Constant work can get boring and exhausting; it is just normal that you require a bit of break in between. If you want to enjoy your periodic breaks without having to leave the room, this setup from a house in Toulouse shows you exactly how to &#8211; by setting up your work desk and telly in the same room, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>17. Working musically</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gu06fl/finally_sorted_out_my_room_got_rid_of_34_of_the/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Finally sorted out my room, got rid of 3/4 of the shelving, hung my guitars up, and PLANTS</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Every professional musician’s fantasy involves a nice, quiet spot to work, with a wall that holds all his precious musical instruments &#8211; this setup provides exactly that. A nice quiet cup of tea and a soothing desktop wallpaper (Quiet, by Dennis Istomin in this case) obviously help wake your creative beast up.</p>



<h2>18. Nature is the best catalyst to productivity</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gti2vy/saturday_sun/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Saturday Sun</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>What better place to get work done, than in front of a window that allows you to peek right into the very heart of nature? Throw in a few indoor plants as well, to enhance the vibe and maximize the benefits of working in a natural environment.</p>



<h2>19. The color of Earth</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gt61zh/where_i_spend_too_much_time_these_days/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Where I spend too much time these days</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The Earth-colored walls and table give this home workplace a natural feel. Add to it the inspiring Humpback Whale poster, and you have a workplace that is silent, yet has an invigorating energy all around it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>20. Serenity</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gs8rcz/can_i_work_from_home_forever/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Can I work from home forever?</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>IT workers often prefer a nice, quiet space for working. So, it is no surprise that for many such workers, a work-from-home setup is a welcome one. This setup gives you a secluded spot to get your job done, while ensuring that you stay in touch with nature and the outside world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>21. Classy and timeless</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gs7swp/my_setup_at_the_office/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My Setup at the Office</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Even though this conventional looking setup is from an actual office, such a workplace can be easily set up at home. All you need is a quiet room and a decent-sized desk to place all your work-related equipment, and you have a home office setup that is no less than the one you just left behind at the office.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>22. Peaceful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gs8n2p/the_best_way_to_deal_with_work_from_home/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">The best way to deal with work from home</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A common complaint that people working from home have, is that they are unable to find a calm spot where they can work uninterrupted. Reddit user <em>liI-xaniel</em> has provided a solution which is cheap and effective. Just choose any corner of your house, put up a desk, place your things, and fire away without any distractions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>23. Less is more</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gs48xo/still_waiting_on_the_new_computer_but_the_rest_is/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Still waiting on the new computer but the rest is ready to go!!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This brilliant setup by Reddit user <em>blairnet</em>, shows us how to make the most of a not-very-large space. The user has managed to accommodate a full-blown work setup, effectively, in one corner of a medium sized room, without making it seem congested or uncomfortable to work in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>24. Basements are useful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/grr1ll/finally_got_the_basement_workplace_finished/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Finally got the basement workplace finished #Secretlab</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>House owners often consider basements a place where all the house junk, never to be used, is stashed away. However, this setup shows us how, with the right kind of effort and motivation, a basement can be transformed into a stunning and smart workplace. After all, the fact that nobody ever enters the basement, makes it the perfect spot to get your work done without being disturbed.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>25. Another minimalist design</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Yet another example of how you do not need an entire room to set up an effective home working space. A desktop, holding your computers and other important items, along with a wall carrying some stunning art, is more than a good enough workplace.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>26. Nice and cozy</h2>

<p>If you are working from home, you need to feel like you are at home &#8211; relaxed. This room provides you with a working space while keeping you at ease. When exhausted, you can lie down on the sofa; when looking for a break, you can step out on the balcony with a hot cup of coffee; when wanting to relax your tired eyes out, you can always stare at the colorful plants spread throughout the room.</p>



<h2>27. Blue is brilliant</h2>

<p>Although wide desks are good for setting up unitary workspaces, you need vertical outreach for accommodating books, documents, and decorative items to make the workspace a holistic part of the interior plan. Here is why we added the Tangkula Computer desk to our list.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>While each one of the three desks is differently manufactured and priced, they are each good looking black desks in their own way. The first product from Foxemart is our personal favorite due to the minimalistic design and more than adequate working space.</p>



<p>However, if you are looking for additional space and a workstation that isn’t horizontally-scaled, the product flaunting the hutch from Tangkula is the best possible option.</p>



<p>Lastly, if two individuals are to be accommodated on a single workstation or you need to switch between tasks and have two workspaces on display, the l-shaped corner writing desk from Tribesigns is the perfect fit. Overall, each one of the products is highly affordable and boasts of uncompromising quality.</p>
