<p>One of the many benefits of using an SSD storage device is its fast performance but because of its cost, a lot of gamers prefer to use an SSD with a low capacity storage feature. </p>



<p>With time, the SSD becomes full because of its inability to store heavy data, which leads to the slow performance of these games and the operating system.</p>



<p>To enhance the functionality of the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> SSD, these games have to be moved to another storage device which in most cases is an HDD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HDD has a large storage capacity which makes it suitable for storing games, and thus creating space on the SSD to enhance the speed and performance of these games.</p>



<p>Moving games between two storage locations can be quite tricky especially because they need to function well in their new location.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Moving Games From SSD To HDD</h2>







<h3>Copying</h3>



<p>Games can be moved from SSD to HDD by copying the selected games from their previous location on the SSD and pasting them in a new folder that is saved on HDD. The games saved on the previous SSD location have to be deleted so that the computer can recognize a single file. Some games do not support direct copying and Pasting between different storage files and so will need to be re-installed on the new storage device.</p>



<h3>Software</h3>



<p>Moving games between different storage devices with the aid of well-optimized software eliminates the need for re-installing the games on the new storage device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Games can be easily moved in large numbers via software such as a Steam mover application that is highly suitable for moving different types of games to a new storage location. Although the process of moving games is slightly different among various software, they all support changing of the storage location on the gaming properties.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Using a software or the copy and paste method for moving games is a safe way to move your games without corrupting them. However, it is advisable to use software to move heavy games in large numbers and to use the copy and paste method to move games in bits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone has an inborn detective ability and likes to play it out once in a while. After watching a movie, we feel that we can better handle the crime-solving scenes if given a chance to take up the lead role and let all our purported actions play out only in our heads. </p>



<p>Well, the good news is that there is a wonderful game that allows you to solve crimes and unravel mysteries using a first-person narrative that puts you in charge of most of the major happenings in the story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nancy Drew games are usually divided into two different gameplay levels with different puzzles to cater to different ages without interrupting the plot of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;All Nancy Drew games have a low ESRB rating for mild violence, and this makes it a great <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/computer-monitors-for-gaming/">Gaming</a> choice to engage kids, teenagers, and adults.</p>

<p>Nothing does it best other than a gaming computer being used for gaming, it is like placing a lion on a race lane against a dog, and it will always outrun the dog and possibly have the dog eaten. The same is the case for the Acer Predator Helios 300, a gaming computer built for gaming.</p>



<p>You get 300 nits of brightness on this computer when you play your World of Warcraft games, while the 144Hz refresh rate does great with clear and clean visuals as you load your game with ease.</p>



<p>The NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 2060 graphics card adds much to your visual reality, while the 15.6 inches widescreen display with a 1080p resolution is more than pure bliss for the gamer.</p>



<p>The 5.0GHz speed of the processor means your world of Warcraft will never experience lags when you load and run it on your computer. The 16GB of ram is another delight for your prompt loads and processing, while the keypad lights add much if you want to game in dark rooms.</p>



<p>The storage is upgradeable. Still, at 512GB, it affords you great storage space for everything you will want to save, and the retrieval process is seamless as it is with SSD storage. On top of it is the 10<sup>th</sup> generation Intel core i7 processor and a 3ms overdrive response time, with over 6 hours of battery life.</p>



<h2>Pros And Cons</h2>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>RTX GPU</li><li>Upgradable SSD</li><li>15-inch screen</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Lack of thunderbolt support</li><li>Looks bulky</li></ul>
