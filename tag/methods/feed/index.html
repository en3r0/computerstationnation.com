<p>For some reasons, you might be moving to a new city, or state, or even country and you have to bring along your properties. Of course, there are a lot of convenient options for moving your things to your new place but you’ll agree with me that some things have to be handled with care because they can be easily damaged during transit. </p>



<p>One of such things that require extreme care during transit due to its fragile structure is a <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/">computer monitor</a> and one of the safest ways to move a computer is by shipping it through a well-qualified and highly recommended shipping agency.</p>



<p>Before, concluding on the shipping process, your computer must be well packed to prevent damages upon arrival. Contrary to what you might think, packaging your computer is a&nbsp; thoughtful way of protecting it during transit, and it is easy too if you follow a few steps. This is the reason we have listed three ways to ship a computer. </p>



<p>The first is known  as the box and cushion method, the second is known as a computer tower method and the last is known as minimalistic method.</p>







<h2>The Box And Cushion Method</h2>



<p>You can use the box that it was shipped with upon purchase or anyone that fits it perfectly after measuring the size of the box.&nbsp; Ensure that the box is not too big to avoid shifting during transit or too small to prevent unwanted pressure that can damage your computer.</p>



<p>After placing the computer in the box, fill it with bubble wrap or anti-static packing peanuts to create a firm cushioning for it. Ensure that all the four corners of the box are well cushioned to ensure that it is firm and sturdy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After filling the box, the next step is to wrap the box with plastic and seal the wrapping with tape. Place the wrapped box into another box and affix your name and other relevant information as directed by your preferred shipping agency for proper identification on the box. </p>



<p>The purpose of placing the already-wrapped computer box into another box is to protect it from spillage or an unprecedented fall during transit.</p>



<p>Seal the box with clear packing tape and ensure that it is properly wrapped. Locate your preferred shipping company and send it to them for shipping to any location that you want through your preferred shipping method.</p>



<h2>The Computer Tower</h2>



<p>Shipping a computer/ desktop tower is unlike shipping other computer parts because of its weight and the fragile components. They’re fragile not because they can be easily broken but because they can be easily damaged. Their presence is essential to the computer tower&#8217;s overall functioning, hence the need to keep them safe during transit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shipping a computer/desktop tower is not as difficult as you think. No doubt, the size and weight of a tower can make packaging and shipping a bit of an herculean task but if you follow the steps outlined in this article, shipping a computer/ desktop tower will be as easy as simple arithmetic.</p>



<p>Before you start packaging, you should ensure that everything you’ll need is close at hand and that includes two large boxes; one slightly bigger than the other, bubble wraps or anti-static packing peanuts, and wrapping tape.&nbsp; Now, let’s get started.</p>



<ul><li>Disassemble the computer tower and take out heavy and fragile parts (such as the GPU) that might make packaging and shipping stressful for you. The parts that have been taken out should be carefully wrapped in another box and carefully sealed with relevant details for proper and easy identification upon arrival.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Carefully place the tower in a box. You can use the original box that it was shipped with upon purchase or you can get another box after accurately measuring the width and length of the tower.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>Advisable, the box should not be a perfect fit for the tower. In other words, it should be a few inches larger so that it can contain the cushioning for your desktop/ computer tower.&nbsp; After placing the tower into the box, fill the spaces with bubble wrap or anti-static packing peanuts to provide cushioning for the tower without adding weight to the box.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>After filling the box, seal it with packing tape and place it along with other sealed and well-packaged components of the computer/ desktop tower into a larger box. Ensure that the box fits well to avoid shifting during transit.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Carefully affix your name and other relevant information on the box as instructed by the shipping company whose services you want to use. If you do not have any shipping company in mind, you can find a handful of them online with reviews and ratings of customers that have patronized them.</li></ul>



<h2>The Minimalistic Method</h2>



<p>A desktop computer is one of the most popular choices for a simple and traditional computer setup, but with this simplicity comes the complexity in shipping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its various accessories make it a bit of a challenge to pack for shipping to any preferred location. Still, knowledge is power, and this article contains easy steps to help you pack your desktop computer for shipping.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before you roll up your sleeves and open your boxes to start packing, ensure that all the necessary materials are available to avoid frequent visits to the market to get them when there’s a work in progress. Now, let&#8217;s get down to business:</p>



<ul><li>Unplug your computer accessories such as the mouse, keyboard, computer monitor, and other cables from the desktop tower.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Carefully pack the mouse, keyboard, and other cables and wrap them with plastic. You can put them in a plastic bag or any other wrapping that you prefer. Please place them in a box and identify them with a sticky paper that outlines the box&#8217;s contents. ( do the same for every other box)</li></ul>



<ul><li>The next device that you should be well packaged for proper shipping is the computer monitor. This fragile device requires the utmost attention to detail when packing it to protect it from getting damages caused by transit drop, and pressure.</li></ul>



<ul><li>To safely pack your computer, carefully wrap it with plastic and place it in a box that is 3” wider than the monitor size.&nbsp; Fill the spaces with anti-static packing peanuts or any other preferred cushioning but ensure that it is not too tight to avoid mounting pressure on the monitor. Seal the box with packing tape and identify the contents with sticky paper.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Repeat the above process with the desktop tower and identify the contents with a sticky paper. You can also choose to disassemble the computer tower, but this is only advisable if you can assemble it yourself.</li></ul>



<ul><li>After packing the monitor, tower, and other computer devices in separate boxes that have been properly identified, neatly arrange all the boxes in a larger shipping box. Place the box that contains the desktop tower at the bottom of the box and arrange the rest as deemed fit, but ensure that you do not mount pressure on the monitor.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Seal the shipping box twice with packing tape and attach a sticky paper containing your shipping information and other relevant data as requested by the shipping company you want to patronize.</li></ul>
