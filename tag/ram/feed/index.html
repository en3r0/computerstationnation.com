<p>How much video RAM you need depends on what you are doing. In gaming, the more graphically demanding the game or the higher the resolution you’re playing at, the more Video Random Access Memory (VRAM) you’ll need. </p>



<p>Today, modern <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> games often use more than 2 GB of VRAM, but rarely more than 4 GB. To make things more complicated, games don’t use a fixed amount of RAM but use a variable amount depending on: What is happening on screen?</p>



<h2><strong>What Are Modern Graphics Card </strong></h2>



<p>Modern graphics cards come with between 2 and 12 gigabytes of video RAM (VRAM) built into the graphics card. AMD recently released the RX 480, with models coming with 4 or 8 gigabytes of VRAM. But does that extra VRAM come in handy? How much do you really need?</p>



<p><br>Techspot tested three different graphics cards with models that were equivalent aside from their amount of VRAM. Performance was essentially identical at this resolution, even when cutting the amount of VRAM in half.</p>



<p><br>Even when raising the resolution, there is little difference between the cards, including cards with only 2 gigabytes. Where there is a noticeable difference, the frame rate isn’t high enough to be playable anyway. Lowering the settings to increase the frame rate to a playable level removes the cards&#8217; performance difference.<br></p>



<p>The biggest difference showed up with Rainbow Six Siege, where an R9 380 with 4GB of VRAM was 26% faster than an R9 380 with 2GB of VRAM at 2560 x 1600 resolution and on Ultra settings. In this situation, it would definitely be worth paying for the extra VRAM.</p>



<p>Paying more for more VRAM is rarely worth it from a price-to-performance perspective. Unless you know that your particular game, graphical settings, and resolution will benefit, then choose a graphics card based on the GPU itself and don’t worry about the amount of VRAM. Getting a more powerful GPU with less VRAM is always a better idea than getting a slower GPU with more VRAM.</p>



<h2><strong>What is a VRAM?</strong></h2>



<p>Just like the RAM in your computer offers your CPU quick access to the important data it needs to carry out processes, VRAM works essentially the same, as it offers your GPU quick access to the data it needs to carry out graphics-related processes.</p>



<p><br>Because VRAM is built onto your graphics card, it is much quicker for your GPU to access the data that it holds, rather than if your GPU were to access that same data from your system’s memory or the SSD/HDD in your computer.<br></p>



<p>Unlike RAM, however, you can’t install more VRAM in your system or on your graphics card. Again, VRAM is built directly onto the graphics card. So, your graphics card&#8217;s amount of VRAM is the amount of VRAM your GPU and system will have to use until you upgrade your graphics card.</p>



<h2>How Monitor Resolution Impact’s VRAM?</h2>



<p>In the simplest of terms, the higher the resolution a monitor has, the more VRAM will be used to process a single frame. Just like how the higher the resolution of a monitor, the more VRAM it will utilize, the more detailed and graphics-intensive a game is, the more VRAM it will utilize.</p>



<p><br>So, for instance, games like Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft won’t utilize as much VRAM as games like Middle Earth: Shadow of War, or Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds. The former games aren’t games that are known for the graphics quality and details, while the latter games offer much more advanced scenery and graphics details.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Minecraft isn’t a very detailed game, and it won’t utilize as much VRAM as a more demanding game like Middle Earth: Shadow of War.<br>And, really, since better graphics really means more data, that means that a single frame in a more graphics-demanding game will have more data to process than will a single frame in a less demanding game.</p>

<p>RAM means Random Access Memory. RAM is also known as main memory, primary memory, or system memory. It one of the important components of a computer and without it, a computer won’t work. It is where data is stored and retrieved, but it is for a short time, and it cannot retain data in the absence of power. </p>



<p>It also supports up to 64GB of DDR4 – 2133/1866 MHz and DDR3L 1600/1333 MHz RAM, has integrated Intel HD Graphics 530, SSE 4.1/4.2 &amp; AVX 2.0 Extensions and AES New instructions. It can be overclocked, although the overclocking cannot pass its maximum turbo frequency. </p>



<p>It had an integrated Intel HD Graphics 530 with 24 EUs, which is clocked at 350 &#8211; 1150 MHz which handles the graphics. It has basic parameters such as number of cores, number of threads, base frequency, turbo boost clock, lithography, cache size, and multiplier lock state.</p>

<p>It has a speed of 3200MHz, which contributes significantly to PC games and other relevant applications. The RAM reflects different performance benchmarks. The CL or CAS latency is when it takes to send a column address and get a response. </p>



<p>It has a CL of 16. The tRCD is the required clock cycle necessary after a row of memory is opened before columns within it can be accessed. The tRP is the clock cycle necessary after the precharge command is executed before the first row is opened. The tRAS is the clock necessary after a bank active command before the ensuing precharge command is executed.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<p> It is the latest technology<br>• It has 4 stick count<br>• It can run a huge array of applications</p>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li> It is costly</li><li>It requires clock cycles after a row of memory is opened.</li></ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It can either be static RAM or dynamic RAM. Static RAM is super &#8211; fast, which makes it ideal memory chips. Dynamic RAM is slow, but its power consumption is less than static RAM. RAM is different from storage. The performance of a computer is attributed to the amount of memory it has. </p>



<p>If it does not have the required memory to run, it will result to slow performance. The more memory a computer has, the more information it can process quickly. Currently, the largest single stick of RAM is 128 GB.</p>



<p>The Intel Core i7 6700k is a K series processor. It is a quad-core 64 but x 86 high-end performance desktop microprocessor. It supports up to 1600/2133MHz memory in both DDR4 and DDR3L. The CPU runs to 4.2 GHz and can execute up to 8 threads simultaneously. </p>



<p>The Intel Core i7 6700k is a high-end processor, and it is a product of class. We have picked 3 outstanding RAMs for Intel i7 6700k in this article. To reduce your time of surfing the internet, we recommend the Corsair DOMINATOR Platinum Series 16GB (4 x 4GB) DDR 4 DRAM 3200MHz if budget is no an issue because it has the latest technology compared to the other two and very efficient piece of technology.<br>For more options, visit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=computersta08-20">Amazon</a>.</p>
