<p>CPU means Central Processing Unit. It is also called the central processor, main processor, or processor. It is the principal part of a computer and it composes of the main memory, a control unit, an arithmetic- logic unit. It is the heart of the computer and it is linked with input and output devices and auxiliary storage units. </p>



<p>The CPU is contained on an integrated circuit chip called a microprocessor. It regulates the operations of the computer. It receives data from the main memory and interprets them in order to activate other elements of the computer at the appropriate moment to perform their respective operations.</p>



<p>GeForce GTX 1080 is a high-end <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> graphics card by NVIDIA, launched in May 2016.

<p>The Intel Core i5-8400 is one of the most affordable processors. Intel processors normally come with hyperthreading, before Intel cut it off and increased the physical cores. </p>



<p>The elimination of hyperthreading from the mainstream processors and the increased cores gives it a great advantage. It comes with core counts which are equals to the i5 8600K, which is expensive hardware for a budget build.</p>



<p>This processor doesn’t bottleneck with GTX 1080 and you can get the maximum performance out of your hardware. It cannot overclock but the Intel hyper-threading allows the user to get some exceptional clocks but within certain limits.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>It has strong multi-thread performance</li><li>It has an Intel stock cooler</li><li>Best gaming performance</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>There is no hyperthreading</li><li>Manual overclocking</li></ul>

<p>The AMD Ryzen 5 2600x has a single-core performance of both Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 series processors. Usually, we’ve seen Intel processors giving a great raw performance for gaming while AMD processors are providing the best in class performance for multi-tasking applications. </p>



<p>One thing that makes this processor more appealing is AMD promised their users that even Zen4 architecture would use the same socket and all you need to do is upgrade the BIOS of the motherboard.</p>



<p>The in-game performance of this processor is slightly better than the Intel Core i5 9400f or other mainstream processors. More interestingly the multi-core performance of this processor is much better than the similar Intel CPUs. </p>



<p>Also, the bundled coolers increase their value in which the user can use for the stock clocks, but for some little overclocking the user has to change the cooler. </p>



<p>The six cores and twelve threads of this processor are enough to max out most of the latest tiles while the simultaneous multithreading allows you to do streaming or rendering.<br></p>



<p>The clock speed of this processor is 3.6 GHz while on max turbo it can easily hit the speed of 4.6 GHz and there you have got some overclocking margin that will more boost its performance in games.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>It comes with a bundled cooler.</li><li>Superb performance.</li><li>It has to overclock feature.</li></ul>

<p>You may wish to keep your Graphics card away for a few days, months, or years. The reason for storing the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> graphics card can be founded on several reasons, but regardless, you want to have the card in the best form possible when you need it again and fit for purposes it is supposed to perform.</p>



<p>How you store this card, will determine if you will end up using it again, after keeping it away for a few years or months and even days. Someone suggested that if fridges could store drinks and foods for a long while, and owning to the cool environment, it would be great for storing a graphics card.</p>



<p>While new and improved cards are coming through and hitting our screens with all the intensity in the world, the truth is that there will still be things your old card will be notable for, and this is why you must store it properly.</p>







<h2>Here are a few ways to achieve this result:</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Use an anti-static bag or box</strong></h3>



<p>There is no better place to start this list than here, this beautiful mention. The goal of storing your Graphics card is to keep it for use later and this is one that you equally agree to, to achieve this goal; your card must be kept away from static electricity.</p>



<p>Static electricity will destroy your card then save it. Keeping the card away from the rays and damaging effect of static electricity is your best bite, and you eat this bite with your eyes closed.</p>



<p>Similarly, ensure there is no space in the bag or box, if there is any, pad the space with paper. Make sure the card is perfectly padded, to save it away from the usual effects of fall and knocks that may damage the card and affect its functionality.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Cardboard box</strong></h3>



<p>Card boxes are great and an excellent way to store your graphics card when not in use, but this option must be given attention. Just like the anti-static bag or box, it must be observed that there should be no free space in the box, this way your card does not get affected by movement, and knocks.</p>



<p>Also, a cardboard box provides amazing protection from static electricity and this is everything you are trying to avoid. With static electricity of the way, you are two times ahead of your game and in perfect shape to have the card available for use again.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Plastic box</strong></h3>



<p>Here is another great way to protect and save your card for the future and the next time you may want to use your graphics card again, the plastic box provides perfect protection from static electricity, this of course is our most important feature to look out for.</p>



<p>It is also waterproof, so you do not have to fear where and how the box is placed. You are guaranteed protection from the most important aspect, static electricity.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Original box</strong></h3>



<p>Your graphics card always comes in a custom size box, packed to give the card the best protection and it is made fit for purpose. So if you intend to keep your card away for a little way? Getting it back into the box will be a great way to go, and this will guarantee amazing protection.</p>



<p>There are downsides and we know it, you might have lost the box. Moreover, just like the many, you may have damaged it out of that first-time experience and excitement or it has been damaged by water or even confiscated. You can try out the other options on the list to balance it up.</p>



<h3>5.<strong>Get a carrying case</strong></h3>



<p>A safe is it, and this will give you long-term protection if you have the singular intention of keeping the card away for a usually long time. </p>



<p>A carrying case will be the best option on this list, it offers the best protection. It is waterproof, a fantastic addition and on top of this, it is shockproof.</p>

<p>Fan bearings just like your car engine will need some greasing occasionally and this is what you do when you experience issues with your graphics card when it won’t just spin. Add in a little oil and you are good to go, this is one guaranteed way that has shown tremendous results.</p>



<p>So get the fans oiled and you can be sure to have the bliss you require on your graphics compartment.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Clean the fans of dust and debris</strong></h3>



<p>Debris in the CPU has a way of coming to rest in your GPU and of course; where else other than your graphics fan, will they find the comfort they seek?</p>



<p>This is the problem with the graphics card fan, when debris gets here and is stocked, your fan will not spin.</p>



<p>A thorough cleaning will make the difference and set you apart, on a great journey. Getting compressed air will be, as the magic powder that clears dirt’s and this will surely get your fan spinning again.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why losing your graphics card or getting it destroyed now is not the best thing for you, one of these reasons is that you will likely have difficulties in getting a replacement. </p>



<p>This is what we have seen with the bearish market on the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer </a>graphics card in 2021, the scarcity is just unbearable. Another reason is that they get costlier, ever heard the adage that &#8220;old is gold&#8221; sometimes this is what happens with the graphics card, they are programs that no new version can run better than the old one. So keep it safe, even when transporting it.</p>



<p>The fragile nature of the graphics card shows it deserves attention and much balance when you are moving it. The reason is that the card can be affected by bumps, and when you do not protect your Graphics card, you will end up damaging it and not using it for the purpose it was bought for.</p>



<p>Static electricity is one of the major nemeses of the graphics card when you are transporting or storing the card. The need to keep it safe, away from static electricity is one object that will pay the greatest reward.</p>



<p>In this article, we will teach you how to do this and with much ease, you need not worry, as we have proven methods to safely transport your card. So let&#8217;s dive into the options</p>







<h2> Proven Methods To Safely Transport Your Card</h2>



<h2>1.<strong>Use the box the card came with:</strong></h2>



<p>Graphics cards always come in custom size boxes, packed to suit the length and depth of the card and this offers the best protection for the card. Moreover, for you that is moving your card, getting it back into the box it came with. Will save you the extra cash, to be spent on other alternative options available in the market.</p>



<p>We understand there could be instances where the box had been damaged, or just like many, you throw it away with the hope that you would not need it again. These things happen to all of us and this is why we have other options to save you the stress if you cannot find your box anymore.</p>



<h2>2.<strong>Get an anti-static bag or box</strong></h2>



<p>So the second option you can try out if you have lost the box the card came with is to get an anti-static bag or box, we are particular about the bag, it cannot be just any kind of bag. </p>



<p>It should be an anti-static bag or box, static electricity as we have earlier introduced and mentioned, causes harm to your Graphics card.You should not put the card away on the premise of keeping it safe, only to discover you contributed to the defective state of the card, especially when transporting it. </p>



<p>So ensure to keep it safe, by getting a bag that will not expose the card to static electricity, this way you will have a win-win situation.</p>



<h2>3.<strong> Use a Cardboard Box</strong></h2>



<p>A card box is your next option if you do not fancy the first two, or just want to try out other options. Moreover, why the card box you may ask? The first reason for the choice of the card box is that it shields you from static electricity, and this is everything we want to do.</p>



<p>Therefore, with a card box, you are guaranteed protection from static electricity. And your card will be in the best form of protection available in the market, and when you are transporting it. There is just one thing you must take note of when using this option.</p>



<p>Even with a card box, you can still damage your graphics card if the box is just too big and you fail to pay for the remaining space. You must leave nothing to chances, so get it padded with the paper if you find enough space in your box to ensure it does not move.</p>



<h2>4. <strong>Get a heavy-duty carrying case</strong></h2>



<p>This may be a big ask, especially for the cost of getting the carrying case but trust me this is one great option you can try out. There are many advantages with using a heavy-duty carrying case and this is not just for your graphics card alone, but for other things, you may want to transport.</p>



<p>The case is waterproof, you have a quality guarantee, that water cannot get into your safe and destroy your card. This is a major improvement, as against the other four options on the list and you cannot agree less that it is the most effective.</p>



<p>In addition to being waterproof, a carrying case is also shockproof, nothing happens to your card if the card somersaults, and yes we are not praying for this but this is just how much protection a carrying safe offers you. </p>



<p>Regardless of your budget, you can easily find a carrying safe that fits it.</p>



<h2>5. <strong>Use a plastic box</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, a plastic box. Moreover, this is one great option you can try as a seasoned way of safely transporting your graphics card. The plastic box had been used by many and it has proved effective, interesting it is waterproof, however, we cannot guarantee its shockproof content.</p>

<h3>2. <strong>Check your fans</strong></h3>



<p>Sometimes the solutions we seek are there for us, but because they are negligible, we seem not to attach the needed attention to it and get it to fix just the way it is supposed to. Therefore, checking your fan can be the next great thing you can do to fix your graphics card vibrations and this is free.</p>



<p>Checking your fans will reveal the true state of the graphics card, what is responsible for your vibrations can be a dusty fan or a fan that has stopped working. So check this and try it out, it can save you from taking the next options on the list.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Replace your graphics card:</strong></h3>



<p>Sometimes, the reason for the vibrations can be a graphics card that has fail or stop working. All you have to do is to replace it with a new one, this way you get the vibrations stopped and you get a permanent fix to the situation. A win-win solution at all times.</p>



<p>Getting a new graphics card can also be advantageous to your overall development, as you get improved performance on your computer. </p>



<p>You should ensure that you are getting the right graphics card at the right time, this is not a time to experiment with things, you have to go with what works.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Electronic equipment and materials use electromagnetic coils as inductors or transformers. However, graphics cards, serve as inductors, and when current passes through the coils; it creates a magnetic field around it. </p>



<p>This field plays a huge role in how your card functions, and also the cause of vibration sometimes. Graphics cards require a strong current for it working, and when an unusual strong power passes through these coils, it causes the coil to vibrate, this happens usually when your graphics card is under immense load. </p>



<p>This particular problem is what is called graphics card vibration or coil whine. While there is no generally accepted single format to fix this problem, they are a couple of options you can try to arrive at the best result for your graphics card. We have highlighted these options on our list and trust me they are options you can try out, even on a budget.</p>



<p>Your connections can go wrong and this will surely affect how your graphics card works, a graphics card vibration is one of the regular defects you will experience on your computer with wrong connections on your graphics card.</p>

<h2>Top 5 Ways </h2>



<p><strong>1.Use it to play less demanding games: </strong></p>



<p>You can use this for less demanding games or when you want a partner to join in your gaming. The other person could use the old graphics card you had saved.</p>



<p><strong>2.Use it for building a home theatre: </strong></p>



<p>You could build yourself a home theater PC. This is perfect for playing a 4K video in your living room. Building a home theater personal computer (HTPC) from scratch allows for customization, and saves money as well, as it is cheaper than similar specifications from reputed companies.</p>



<p> Apart from saving money, a do-it-yourself HTPC can be a rewarding experience. Very little technical knowledge is required as connections are all labeled. You can use it in a later PC build for home theater setup for making your TV a SMART TV (Make sure your video card can handle 1080P, though it&#8217;s pretty common now &#8211; GT 210 can do that too) If you are doing this I recommend Core 2 Quad since they are pretty cheap, and so is DDR2 RAM.</p>



<p><strong>3. Use it For Test Card</strong></p>



<p><span style="font-size: revert;">You can use it as a test card. If you’re concerned that something is wrong with your motherboard—or that a PCI slot is acting up or something—swap your new graphics card with this one to see the difference. If you think you cannot sell it because it&#8217;s too old and it still works just keep it. Make sure it&#8217;s nicely repackaged or kept in a clean area and use it as a test card. You never know when a dead card could come in.</span> </p>



<p><strong>4. Use it For Crypto Mining</strong></p>



<p> <span style="font-size: revert;">You could build a cryptocurrency mining rig, even though the cost of operating one will probably outweigh any monetary value it provides.</span> </p>



<p><strong>5. Use it as Dummy </strong></p>



<p><span style="font-size: revert;">You could use the card as a dummy, don’t-care-if-it-breaks card for practicing more complicated geeky techniques, such as installing a water block or replacing a stock cooler with an aftermarket cooler.</span> </p>



<p><strong>5. Sell it </strong></p>



<p><span style="font-size: revert;">You could swap it to someone for something else you need for your system—or sell it outright to earn some money for buying something you like, you can use it to buy more RAM, a new PSU for your new graphics card, more storage, a new case, gaming mouse, gaming keyboard, headset, pen drive, etc.</span> </p>



<p>Speaking of selling, you could always sell it on Amazon. You could also put your old graphics card on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. You can also ask friends if they’re interested in your older graphic cards. These are some of the companies you can sell your old graphic cards to:<br></p>



<p><strong>ITAD Companie</strong>s</p>



<p>There are two things to be aware of before selling to an ITAD company. First, ITAD companies have to buy and sell for a profit. This means that you will end up with a little less than direct selling, though the counter benefits, such as trust, speed, and ease make up for the cut in payment. In other instances though, you’ll actually get a higher return than you would have gotten in direct selling. This is because ITAD company&#8217;s remarketing network allows people to find buyers who are a good fit.</p>



<p>Second, ITAD companies do not buy just single parts or the total value of parts less than $1,000. So, if you have $200 worth of graphics cards, this won’t work for you and you’ll need to choose a peer-to-peer network.</p>



<p><strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong></p>



<p>There are some downsides to Facebook marketplace though. Here are some to think about. First, you could get a lot of messages about your GPU listing with redundant questions. Just make your listing as complete as possible.</p>



<p>Next, keep in mind that there is no platform to sell, charge, or ship your products. This means that you may have to make time to meet potential buyers and get paid directly. I advise meeting in public areas and not your home or work.</p>



<p>Lastly, there are lots of scams involving checks and credit cards in peer-to-peer networks like this, so I advise only taking cash to avoid these scams</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>You could just give it away. You’ll make no money, but maybe you’ll help a kid get their first Minecraft rig up and running. Isn’t that its own reward you can also store it in a safe place for spare use? Interestingly, you could recycle it as well.</p>

<p>How much video RAM you need depends on what you are doing. In gaming, the more graphically demanding the game or the higher the resolution you’re playing at, the more Video Random Access Memory (VRAM) you’ll need. </p>



<p>Today, modern <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> games often use more than 2 GB of VRAM, but rarely more than 4 GB. To make things more complicated, games don’t use a fixed amount of RAM but use a variable amount depending on: What is happening on screen?</p>



<h2><strong>What Are Modern Graphics Card </strong></h2>



<p>Modern graphics cards come with between 2 and 12 gigabytes of video RAM (VRAM) built into the graphics card. AMD recently released the RX 480, with models coming with 4 or 8 gigabytes of VRAM. But does that extra VRAM come in handy? How much do you really need?</p>



<p><br>Techspot tested three different graphics cards with models that were equivalent aside from their amount of VRAM. Performance was essentially identical at this resolution, even when cutting the amount of VRAM in half.</p>



<p><br>Even when raising the resolution, there is little difference between the cards, including cards with only 2 gigabytes. Where there is a noticeable difference, the frame rate isn’t high enough to be playable anyway. Lowering the settings to increase the frame rate to a playable level removes the cards&#8217; performance difference.<br></p>



<p>The biggest difference showed up with Rainbow Six Siege, where an R9 380 with 4GB of VRAM was 26% faster than an R9 380 with 2GB of VRAM at 2560 x 1600 resolution and on Ultra settings. In this situation, it would definitely be worth paying for the extra VRAM.</p>



<p>Paying more for more VRAM is rarely worth it from a price-to-performance perspective. Unless you know that your particular game, graphical settings, and resolution will benefit, then choose a graphics card based on the GPU itself and don’t worry about the amount of VRAM. Getting a more powerful GPU with less VRAM is always a better idea than getting a slower GPU with more VRAM.</p>



<h2><strong>What is a VRAM?</strong></h2>



<p>Just like the RAM in your computer offers your CPU quick access to the important data it needs to carry out processes, VRAM works essentially the same, as it offers your GPU quick access to the data it needs to carry out graphics-related processes.</p>



<p><br>Because VRAM is built onto your graphics card, it is much quicker for your GPU to access the data that it holds, rather than if your GPU were to access that same data from your system’s memory or the SSD/HDD in your computer.<br></p>



<p>Unlike RAM, however, you can’t install more VRAM in your system or on your graphics card. Again, VRAM is built directly onto the graphics card. So, your graphics card&#8217;s amount of VRAM is the amount of VRAM your GPU and system will have to use until you upgrade your graphics card.</p>



<h2>How Monitor Resolution Impact’s VRAM?</h2>



<p>In the simplest of terms, the higher the resolution a monitor has, the more VRAM will be used to process a single frame. Just like how the higher the resolution of a monitor, the more VRAM it will utilize, the more detailed and graphics-intensive a game is, the more VRAM it will utilize.</p>



<p><br>So, for instance, games like Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft won’t utilize as much VRAM as games like Middle Earth: Shadow of War, or Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds. The former games aren’t games that are known for the graphics quality and details, while the latter games offer much more advanced scenery and graphics details.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Minecraft isn’t a very detailed game, and it won’t utilize as much VRAM as a more demanding game like Middle Earth: Shadow of War.<br>And, really, since better graphics really means more data, that means that a single frame in a more graphics-demanding game will have more data to process than will a single frame in a less demanding game.</p>
