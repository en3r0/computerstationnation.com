<p>Do you have an old graphics card you don&#8217;t know how to dispose of? I understand that you don’t want to hold onto a card you’ll never use either. It makes sense to keep a backup gear if something happens to your desktop system and you need to get going again.</p>



<p>You can put that<a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/"> computer&#8217;s </a>older graphics card to work instead of throwing an excellent graphics card away. These are some of the ways you can put them to use.</p>



<h2>Top 5 Ways </h2>



<p><strong>1.Use it to play less demanding games: </strong></p>



<p>You can use this for less demanding games or when you want a partner to join in your gaming. The other person could use the old graphics card you had saved.</p>



<p><strong>2.Use it for building a home theatre: </strong></p>



<p>You could build yourself a home theater PC. This is perfect for playing a 4K video in your living room. Building a home theater personal computer (HTPC) from scratch allows for customization, and saves money as well, as it is cheaper than similar specifications from reputed companies.</p>



<p> Apart from saving money, a do-it-yourself HTPC can be a rewarding experience. Very little technical knowledge is required as connections are all labeled. You can use it in a later PC build for home theater setup for making your TV a SMART TV (Make sure your video card can handle 1080P, though it&#8217;s pretty common now &#8211; GT 210 can do that too) If you are doing this I recommend Core 2 Quad since they are pretty cheap, and so is DDR2 RAM.</p>



<p><strong>3. Use it For Test Card</strong></p>



<p><span style="font-size: revert;">You can use it as a test card. If you’re concerned that something is wrong with your motherboard—or that a PCI slot is acting up or something—swap your new graphics card with this one to see the difference. If you think you cannot sell it because it&#8217;s too old and it still works just keep it. Make sure it&#8217;s nicely repackaged or kept in a clean area and use it as a test card. You never know when a dead card could come in.</span> </p>



<p><strong>4. Use it For Crypto Mining</strong></p>



<p> <span style="font-size: revert;">You could build a cryptocurrency mining rig, even though the cost of operating one will probably outweigh any monetary value it provides.</span> </p>



<p><strong>5. Use it as Dummy </strong></p>



<p><span style="font-size: revert;">You could use the card as a dummy, don’t-care-if-it-breaks card for practicing more complicated geeky techniques, such as installing a water block or replacing a stock cooler with an aftermarket cooler.</span> </p>



<p><strong>5. Sell it </strong></p>



<p><span style="font-size: revert;">You could swap it to someone for something else you need for your system—or sell it outright to earn some money for buying something you like, you can use it to buy more RAM, a new PSU for your new graphics card, more storage, a new case, gaming mouse, gaming keyboard, headset, pen drive, etc.</span> </p>



<p>Speaking of selling, you could always sell it on Amazon. You could also put your old graphics card on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. You can also ask friends if they’re interested in your older graphic cards. These are some of the companies you can sell your old graphic cards to:<br></p>



<p><strong>ITAD Companie</strong>s</p>



<p>There are two things to be aware of before selling to an ITAD company. First, ITAD companies have to buy and sell for a profit. This means that you will end up with a little less than direct selling, though the counter benefits, such as trust, speed, and ease make up for the cut in payment. In other instances though, you’ll actually get a higher return than you would have gotten in direct selling. This is because ITAD company&#8217;s remarketing network allows people to find buyers who are a good fit.</p>



<p>Second, ITAD companies do not buy just single parts or the total value of parts less than $1,000. So, if you have $200 worth of graphics cards, this won’t work for you and you’ll need to choose a peer-to-peer network.</p>



<p><strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong></p>



<p>There are some downsides to Facebook marketplace though. Here are some to think about. First, you could get a lot of messages about your GPU listing with redundant questions. Just make your listing as complete as possible.</p>



<p>Next, keep in mind that there is no platform to sell, charge, or ship your products. This means that you may have to make time to meet potential buyers and get paid directly. I advise meeting in public areas and not your home or work.</p>



<p>Lastly, there are lots of scams involving checks and credit cards in peer-to-peer networks like this, so I advise only taking cash to avoid these scams</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>You could just give it away. You’ll make no money, but maybe you’ll help a kid get their first Minecraft rig up and running. Isn’t that its own reward you can also store it in a safe place for spare use? Interestingly, you could recycle it as well.</p>

<p>How much video RAM you need depends on what you are doing. In gaming, the more graphically demanding the game or the higher the resolution you’re playing at, the more Video Random Access Memory (VRAM) you’ll need. </p>



<p>Today, modern <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> games often use more than 2 GB of VRAM, but rarely more than 4 GB. To make things more complicated, games don’t use a fixed amount of RAM but use a variable amount depending on: What is happening on screen?</p>



<h2><strong>What Are Modern Graphics Card </strong></h2>



<p>Modern graphics cards come with between 2 and 12 gigabytes of video RAM (VRAM) built into the graphics card. AMD recently released the RX 480, with models coming with 4 or 8 gigabytes of VRAM. But does that extra VRAM come in handy? How much do you really need?</p>



<p><br>Techspot tested three different graphics cards with models that were equivalent aside from their amount of VRAM. Performance was essentially identical at this resolution, even when cutting the amount of VRAM in half.</p>



<p><br>Even when raising the resolution, there is little difference between the cards, including cards with only 2 gigabytes. Where there is a noticeable difference, the frame rate isn’t high enough to be playable anyway. Lowering the settings to increase the frame rate to a playable level removes the cards&#8217; performance difference.<br></p>



<p>The biggest difference showed up with Rainbow Six Siege, where an R9 380 with 4GB of VRAM was 26% faster than an R9 380 with 2GB of VRAM at 2560 x 1600 resolution and on Ultra settings. In this situation, it would definitely be worth paying for the extra VRAM.</p>



<p>Paying more for more VRAM is rarely worth it from a price-to-performance perspective. Unless you know that your particular game, graphical settings, and resolution will benefit, then choose a graphics card based on the GPU itself and don’t worry about the amount of VRAM. Getting a more powerful GPU with less VRAM is always a better idea than getting a slower GPU with more VRAM.</p>



<h2><strong>What is a VRAM?</strong></h2>



<p>Just like the RAM in your computer offers your CPU quick access to the important data it needs to carry out processes, VRAM works essentially the same, as it offers your GPU quick access to the data it needs to carry out graphics-related processes.</p>



<p><br>Because VRAM is built onto your graphics card, it is much quicker for your GPU to access the data that it holds, rather than if your GPU were to access that same data from your system’s memory or the SSD/HDD in your computer.<br></p>



<p>Unlike RAM, however, you can’t install more VRAM in your system or on your graphics card. Again, VRAM is built directly onto the graphics card. So, your graphics card&#8217;s amount of VRAM is the amount of VRAM your GPU and system will have to use until you upgrade your graphics card.</p>



<h2>How Monitor Resolution Impact’s VRAM?</h2>



<p>In the simplest of terms, the higher the resolution a monitor has, the more VRAM will be used to process a single frame. Just like how the higher the resolution of a monitor, the more VRAM it will utilize, the more detailed and graphics-intensive a game is, the more VRAM it will utilize.</p>



<p><br>So, for instance, games like Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft won’t utilize as much VRAM as games like Middle Earth: Shadow of War, or Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds. The former games aren’t games that are known for the graphics quality and details, while the latter games offer much more advanced scenery and graphics details.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Minecraft isn’t a very detailed game, and it won’t utilize as much VRAM as a more demanding game like Middle Earth: Shadow of War.<br>And, really, since better graphics really means more data, that means that a single frame in a more graphics-demanding game will have more data to process than will a single frame in a less demanding game.</p>
