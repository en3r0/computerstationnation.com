<p>The GTX 1060 is a great <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> graphics card that provides a stunning experience when you get an FHD screen with a 1080P or 1440P resolution. It has a silent running operation and low power consumption. If you overclock the system more than often, then you will love to get this graphics card. </p>



<p>You can also go for the TN panel instead of IPS by compromising with some color output, but you will get a faster response time in TN display which will be a significant advantage in fast-paced games.</p>

With 178-degree horizontal and vertical viewing angles and excellent color consistency, you will get superior clarity and sharp pictures from almost any direction.

<p>If you search for the most popular 144Hz gaming display, you will surely find the Asus VG248QE monitor almost everywhere. It will deliver immensely superior performance over its competitors in the same price range.</p>



<p>Ask any hardcore gamer what matters most and nine out of 10 times you&#8217;ll get a one-word answer—speed. It&#8217;s no secret that fast frame rates not only give you smoother game play but can also give you an edge over those unfortunate souls who have to deal with lag and choppy motion. You can spend thousands on a tricked out gaming rig but if your monitor can&#8217;t display the action smoothly you&#8217;re not getting the most out of your hardware investment.</p>



<p>The VG248QE comes with a dual-link DVI cable and an audio cable but you&#8217;re on your own when it comes to HDMI and DisplayPort cables. The monitor is covered by a three year parts, labor, and backlight warranty.</p>



<p>The VG248QE was able to display almost every shade of gray from the DisplayMate 64-Step Grayscale test, but darks shades of gray could have been a bit darker. There was a hint of clipping at the light end of the scale, which is not uncommon for a TN panel.</p>



<p>As is the case with most TN monitors, the VG248QE has relatively narrow viewing angles. There was some color shifting at around 50-degrees from center from the side and the view from the bottom was dark. This becomes more of an issue when the panel is rotated and the bottom angle becomes the left side angle.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Fast pixel response.</li><li>144Hz refresh rate.</li><li>Ergonomic stand.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>3D gear not included.</li><li>No USB ports.</li></ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a monitor that offers gamer-friendly presets and can handle fast gaming action, the ViewSonic XG2401is a solid choice that won&#8217;t drain your bank account. </p>



<p>Granted, its TN panel doesn&#8217;t offer the gray-scale and viewing-angle performance that you get with an In-Plane Switching (IPS) monitor, but its blazing pixel response, 144Hz refresh rate, and FreeSync capabilities combine to deliver a smooth gaming experience, with no motion blur or ghosting.</p>



<p>As the NVIDIA GTX 1060 is a mid-range graphics card, it mostly supports games that run on 1080P or 1440P screens. Some users also ran 4K videos with GTX 1060, but they accounted for the fluctuation in FPS in some AAA games. They got balanced FPS only after they turned down the settings substantially.</p>



<p>On average, if you want to get the best performance from the GTX 1060 in your system, then you should look for the 1080P or some 1440P displays with an IPS panel and 60HZ or 144Hz refresh rate. </p>



<p>That said, a more powerful set of speakers would be a welcome improvement, as would a few side-mounted USB ports. If color and gray-scale performance are key, check out our Editors&#8217; Choice for midsize gaming monitors, the BenQ XL2420G. </p>



<p>It uses Nvidia&#8217;s G-Sync anti-tearing technology, is a better overall performer, and offers more features and settings than the XG2401, but it&#8217;ll cost you almost twice as much.</p>



<p>The Dell Ultrasharp U2715H is a good monitor for mixed usage. It gets bright, has decent picture quality, and no major flaws. It also comes with a factory calibration that makes it slightly more accurate than average. </p>



<p>It does have poor black uniformity though with some backlight bleed, and a higher refresh rate would be an improvement for gaming. The Asus VG248QE is a 24-inch gaming monitor featuring a 144Hz refresh rate, a speedy pixel response, and a highly adjustable stand. It&#8217;s a good performer but could use a few more gamer-centric features. To view more options, visit <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=computersta08-20">Amazon.com</a></strong></p>

<p>Desktop PCs are built with different types of posts that sustain their functionality and enhance their performance and suitability for accomplishing different tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, regardless of how well equipped the desktop is, it still needs to be paired with a monitor to aid graphic, text, and visual representation of the software installed into the computer. </p>



<p>One of the most basic processors that support the effective and efficient performance of the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> is the graphics processing unit that requires a graphics card to function effectively.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Two Leading Graphics Card Brand</h2>



<p>The two leading brands for graphics cards are Nvidia and AMD and over time, they have produced different forms of graphics cards that are designed to synchronize frame rates for a smooth visual representation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monitors are designed to function with a dedicated graphics card that is inserted via graphics ports that make it suitable for games and visual content. In most situations, the desktop PC or monitor is built with only one PCI Express x16 slot which is built specifically to accommodate a graphics card.</p>



<h2><strong>Primary And Secondary Slots</strong></h2>



<p>Other times, the motherboard is built with two PCIe slots that are regarded as the primary and secondary slots and although they are built with similar features, they perform differently. In such instances, the graphics card should be inserted into the primary PCIe slot because it requires little or no configurations to become effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primary PCIe slot is most times designed to be longer and in some instances, it is identified through a text indicator on the motherboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, if you’re a gamer, designer, entertainer or regardless of the type of work that you need the computer/ monitor to execute, a single graphics card port is enough to cater to the job</p>

<p>Cleaning a <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> is not just about blowing off dust and scrubbing with a clean cloth to make it look neat to onlookers. How are the internal components fairing, do you clean them at all or you probably think they never get dirty and so don’t need cleaning, or maybe you think that there’s a self-cleaning agent built into them.</p>



<p> I’m sorry to disappoint you but those buddies need cleaning too, especially that processor that to a large extent, determines your computer&#8217;s graphics performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cleaning a graphics card is not regarded as important when cleaning a computer&#8217;s internal components and because of your constant neglect, your computer&#8217;s graphics, and frame rendering performance is being affected. Whether you’ve noticed or not, you don’t have to wait till it gets very bad, so pick up an antistatic strap, with your tools, and let’s do some cleaning.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>The Tools</h2>



<p>The tools needed for cleaning a graphics card includes a screwdriver ( a screwdriver set will be a preferable option that offers unlimited access to different types of screws), a dust blower, Isopropyl alcohol, a cleaning cloth, and a thermal paste. Ensure that you do not use any material that will leave residue on the graphics card and get ready to clean in these easy steps.</p>



<h2>The Process</h2>



<ul><li>Unplug the computer and disconnect the graphics card from the motherboard. </li><li>Disassemble the graphics card with a screwdriver and disintegrate the reinforcement chip.</li><li> Disassemble the fan from the port that connects it to a circuit board and Remove the screws holding the plastic cover onto the metal portion of the heat sink. </li><li>Clean the fan to remove dust by using a dust blower, clean the heatsink too by using a dust blower.</li><li> Disassemble all parts of the graphics card and clean with alcohol and a swab. You can choose to clean with a dry cleaning cloth or a cotton swab that provides easy access to all parts of the graphics card. </li><li>Apply thermal paste on all the unscrewed parts of the graphics processing unit and the team sink. </li><li>Affix the heat sink and the fan cover to the graphic processing unit as you prepare to reassemble the graphics card. </li><li>Apply a thin layer of thermal paste on all the unscrewed parts of the GPU to keep it cool and reassemble the graphics card. It is very important to test if the graphics cards, GPU and fans are in good working condition by turning on your computer to check the current performance. If the graphics card is not functioning properly, unscrew the graphics processing unit and reassemble it.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>The AMD Ryzen 5 2600x has a single-core performance of both Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 series processors. Usually, we’ve seen Intel processors giving a great raw performance for gaming while AMD processors are providing the best in class performance for multi-tasking applications. </p>



<p>One thing that makes this processor more appealing is AMD promised their users that even Zen4 architecture would use the same socket and all you need to do is upgrade the BIOS of the motherboard.</p>



<p>The in-game performance of this processor is slightly better than the Intel Core i5 9400f or other mainstream processors. More interestingly the multi-core performance of this processor is much better than the similar Intel CPUs. </p>



<p>Also, the bundled coolers increase their value in which the user can use for the stock clocks, but for some little overclocking the user has to change the cooler. </p>



<p>The six cores and twelve threads of this processor are enough to max out most of the latest tiles while the simultaneous multithreading allows you to do streaming or rendering.<br></p>



<p>The clock speed of this processor is 3.6 GHz while on max turbo it can easily hit the speed of 4.6 GHz and there you have got some overclocking margin that will more boost its performance in games.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>It comes with a bundled cooler.</li><li>Superb performance.</li><li>It has to overclock feature.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li> It generates heat.</li><li>It consumes more power.</li></ul>

<p>You may wish to keep your Graphics card away for a few days, months, or years. The reason for storing the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> graphics card can be founded on several reasons, but regardless, you want to have the card in the best form possible when you need it again and fit for purposes it is supposed to perform.</p>



<p>How you store this card, will determine if you will end up using it again, after keeping it away for a few years or months and even days. Someone suggested that if fridges could store drinks and foods for a long while, and owning to the cool environment, it would be great for storing a graphics card.</p>



<p>While new and improved cards are coming through and hitting our screens with all the intensity in the world, the truth is that there will still be things your old card will be notable for, and this is why you must store it properly.</p>







<h2>Here are a few ways to achieve this result:</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Use an anti-static bag or box</strong></h3>



<p>There is no better place to start this list than here, this beautiful mention. The goal of storing your Graphics card is to keep it for use later and this is one that you equally agree to, to achieve this goal; your card must be kept away from static electricity.</p>



<p>Static electricity will destroy your card then save it. Keeping the card away from the rays and damaging effect of static electricity is your best bite, and you eat this bite with your eyes closed.</p>



<p>Similarly, ensure there is no space in the bag or box, if there is any, pad the space with paper. Make sure the card is perfectly padded, to save it away from the usual effects of fall and knocks that may damage the card and affect its functionality.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Cardboard box</strong></h3>



<p>Card boxes are great and an excellent way to store your graphics card when not in use, but this option must be given attention. Just like the anti-static bag or box, it must be observed that there should be no free space in the box, this way your card does not get affected by movement, and knocks.</p>



<p>Also, a cardboard box provides amazing protection from static electricity and this is everything you are trying to avoid. With static electricity of the way, you are two times ahead of your game and in perfect shape to have the card available for use again.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Plastic box</strong></h3>



<p>Here is another great way to protect and save your card for the future and the next time you may want to use your graphics card again, the plastic box provides perfect protection from static electricity, this of course is our most important feature to look out for.</p>



<p>It is also waterproof, so you do not have to fear where and how the box is placed. You are guaranteed protection from the most important aspect, static electricity.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Original box</strong></h3>



<p>Your graphics card always comes in a custom size box, packed to give the card the best protection and it is made fit for purpose. So if you intend to keep your card away for a little way? Getting it back into the box will be a great way to go, and this will guarantee amazing protection.</p>



<p>There are downsides and we know it, you might have lost the box. Moreover, just like the many, you may have damaged it out of that first-time experience and excitement or it has been damaged by water or even confiscated. You can try out the other options on the list to balance it up.</p>



<h3>5.<strong>Get a carrying case</strong></h3>



<p>A safe is it, and this will give you long-term protection if you have the singular intention of keeping the card away for a usually long time. </p>



<p>A carrying case will be the best option on this list, it offers the best protection. It is waterproof, a fantastic addition and on top of this, it is shockproof.</p>



<p>Yes, a carrying case or safe as you will have it are expensive, but for the sake of the greater good which is the security they provide, risking a few bills to get the best solution in the market won’t be a big ask.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Just as it is important to keep your Graphics card away from static electricity, it must be guided from water damage. If you do not achieve this two essential purpose, it is safe to say that you should forget everything about the card. As the purpose of storing it will be defeated.</p>



<p>Keeping your graphics card safe and in the best condition is a goal that you must hold onto if you are to experience the best results with your storage goals. In addition to selecting any one option on this list, ensure to keep the card in a dry room and at the best temperature.</p>

While this option can be cost-effective, it pays rewards that you will surely love, and this is why we opt to have it on this list.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Check your fans</strong></h3>



<p>Sometimes the solutions we seek are there for us, but because they are negligible, we seem not to attach the needed attention to it and get it to fix just the way it is supposed to. Therefore, checking your fan can be the next great thing you can do to fix your graphics card vibrations and this is free.</p>



<p>Checking your fans will reveal the true state of the graphics card, what is responsible for your vibrations can be a dusty fan or a fan that has stopped working. So check this and try it out, it can save you from taking the next options on the list.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Replace your graphics card:</strong></h3>



<p>Sometimes, the reason for the vibrations can be a graphics card that has fail or stop working. All you have to do is to replace it with a new one, this way you get the vibrations stopped and you get a permanent fix to the situation. A win-win solution at all times.</p>



<p>Getting a new graphics card can also be advantageous to your overall development, as you get improved performance on your computer. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Electronic equipment and materials use electromagnetic coils as inductors or transformers. However, graphics cards, serve as inductors, and when current passes through the coils; it creates a magnetic field around it. </p>



<p>This field plays a huge role in how your card functions, and also the cause of vibration sometimes. Graphics cards require a strong current for it working, and when an unusual strong power passes through these coils, it causes the coil to vibrate, this happens usually when your graphics card is under immense load. </p>



<p>This particular problem is what is called graphics card vibration or coil whine. While there is no generally accepted single format to fix this problem, they are a couple of options you can try to arrive at the best result for your graphics card. We have highlighted these options on our list and trust me they are options you can try out, even on a budget.</p>



<p>Your connections can go wrong and this will surely affect how your graphics card works, a graphics card vibration is one of the regular defects you will experience on your computer with wrong connections on your graphics card.</p>

<p>Do you have an old graphics card you don&#8217;t know how to dispose of? I understand that you don’t want to hold onto a card you’ll never use either. It makes sense to keep a backup gear if something happens to your desktop system and you need to get going again.</p>



<p>You can put that<a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/"> computer&#8217;s </a>older graphics card to work instead of throwing an excellent graphics card away. These are some of the ways you can put them to use.</p>



<h2>Top 5 Ways </h2>



<p><strong>1.Use it to play less demanding games: </strong></p>



<p>You can use this for less demanding games or when you want a partner to join in your gaming. The other person could use the old graphics card you had saved.</p>



<p><strong>2.Use it for building a home theatre: </strong></p>



<p>You could build yourself a home theater PC. This is perfect for playing a 4K video in your living room. Building a home theater personal computer (HTPC) from scratch allows for customization, and saves money as well, as it is cheaper than similar specifications from reputed companies.</p>



<p> Apart from saving money, a do-it-yourself HTPC can be a rewarding experience. Very little technical knowledge is required as connections are all labeled. You can use it in a later PC build for home theater setup for making your TV a SMART TV (Make sure your video card can handle 1080P, though it&#8217;s pretty common now &#8211; GT 210 can do that too) If you are doing this I recommend Core 2 Quad since they are pretty cheap, and so is DDR2 RAM.</p>



<p><strong>3. Use it For Test Card</strong></p>



<p><span style="font-size: revert;">You can use it as a test card. If you’re concerned that something is wrong with your motherboard—or that a PCI slot is acting up or something—swap your new graphics card with this one to see the difference. If you think you cannot sell it because it&#8217;s too old and it still works just keep it. Make sure it&#8217;s nicely repackaged or kept in a clean area and use it as a test card. You never know when a dead card could come in.</span> </p>



<p><strong>4. Use it For Crypto Mining</strong></p>



<p> <span style="font-size: revert;">You could build a cryptocurrency mining rig, even though the cost of operating one will probably outweigh any monetary value it provides.</span> </p>



<p><strong>5. Use it as Dummy </strong></p>



<p><span style="font-size: revert;">You could use the card as a dummy, don’t-care-if-it-breaks card for practicing more complicated geeky techniques, such as installing a water block or replacing a stock cooler with an aftermarket cooler.</span> </p>



<p><strong>5. Sell it </strong></p>



<p><span style="font-size: revert;">You could swap it to someone for something else you need for your system—or sell it outright to earn some money for buying something you like, you can use it to buy more RAM, a new PSU for your new graphics card, more storage, a new case, gaming mouse, gaming keyboard, headset, pen drive, etc.</span> </p>



<p>Speaking of selling, you could always sell it on Amazon. You could also put your old graphics card on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. You can also ask friends if they’re interested in your older graphic cards. These are some of the companies you can sell your old graphic cards to:<br></p>



<p><strong>ITAD Companie</strong>s</p>



<p>There are two things to be aware of before selling to an ITAD company. First, ITAD companies have to buy and sell for a profit. This means that you will end up with a little less than direct selling, though the counter benefits, such as trust, speed, and ease make up for the cut in payment. In other instances though, you’ll actually get a higher return than you would have gotten in direct selling. This is because ITAD company&#8217;s remarketing network allows people to find buyers who are a good fit.</p>



<p>Second, ITAD companies do not buy just single parts or the total value of parts less than $1,000. So, if you have $200 worth of graphics cards, this won’t work for you and you’ll need to choose a peer-to-peer network.</p>



<p><strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong></p>



<p>There are some downsides to Facebook marketplace though. Here are some to think about. First, you could get a lot of messages about your GPU listing with redundant questions. Just make your listing as complete as possible.</p>



<p>Next, keep in mind that there is no platform to sell, charge, or ship your products. This means that you may have to make time to meet potential buyers and get paid directly. I advise meeting in public areas and not your home or work.</p>



<p>Lastly, there are lots of scams involving checks and credit cards in peer-to-peer networks like this, so I advise only taking cash to avoid these scams</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>You could just give it away. You’ll make no money, but maybe you’ll help a kid get their first Minecraft rig up and running. Isn’t that its own reward you can also store it in a safe place for spare use? Interestingly, you could recycle it as well.</p>
