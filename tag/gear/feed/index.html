<p>Here is the auto generated text from this video if you would rather read through that:</p>



<p>the time has come to show off the masterpiece I know it&#8217;s been a long time since the last video you can tell my face has grown long as they say and so is my hair I mean life happens things get busy but this machine&#8217;s been performing beautifully as you can see we got the the RGB strip down here in front cheapo knockoffs fans they don&#8217;t work or a sink that&#8217;s okay I&#8217;m not really concerned about that the only thing that kind of irks me a little bit is I have one RGB header which I put the strip on and so the case comes I you can&#8217;t see from this angle has a little bottom light in the front that works with the or a sink it&#8217;s just shining white because I had to unhook it to plug in the stripper fans of Linux and RGB may be a little disappointed because or sync does not have any native Linux clients there are some scripts out there I believe that people have created but it&#8217;s not quite the same so that stinks I&#8217;ll did I&#8217;ll live with it it&#8217;s fine one other thing is this thing is it does perform beautifully it I mean transfer speeds and everything is just so much faster than what I used to have I don&#8217;t have any benchmarks that I&#8217;ve run because quite frankly I haven&#8217;t had a lot of time and that&#8217;s why this videos late but you know I use it while I&#8217;m working from home every day you know maybe I&#8217;ll make a video on that soon a lot of people ask me how or do you like working from home yes it is awesome and you probably could find a job working from home if you really wanted to maybe there&#8217;s a lot of options out there but that&#8217;s for another video so in the meantime enjoy the beautiful footage [Music] alright guys thanks for watching I really do appreciate it yeah it&#8217;s been it&#8217;s been a lot of fun doing this it&#8217;s also been a good amount of work I apologize for the poor audio quality on something I know I need to fix so hopefully in that next video you you&#8217;ve got to subscribe to get it hopefully in that next video if you subscribe and get it I will have that audio fixed you&#8217;ll be able to hear me so much better so next time</p>

<p>today we are doing an unboxing of the metallic gear neo G many and it is a sub brand of fantex and so that&#8217;s a little bit confusing they&#8217;re brand new I think this summer they came out so not a lot out there on them but I want to one because they look awesome and they are affordable so you might see you might have seen the other video I did where I picked out the the perfect case and for me this was the perfect case because it&#8217;s a bit showy so let&#8217;s let&#8217;s get into it happy new you Mini logo on side and I&#8217;ll just pull it out so we can take a look see Oh what it&#8217;s already been opened whoops we got so yeah I did open this earlier because I just couldn&#8217;t wait for you guys to well I couldn&#8217;t wait this I got a few lights later nothing very very impressive so right away you can see it is in so she&#8217;s beautiful so where do you want to start here we got the patterns is something interesting I noticed when I picked this case out I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about it to be honest but after considering it I decided I could deal with it but um actually I can&#8217;t tell if those are etched in or not I was actually considering if you really wanted to you could probably take those off somehow it looks like it&#8217;s just paint so I&#8217;m not sure if you can just dissolve it with something dry or something fun um in China that&#8217;s to be expected this is tempered glass as it says in the front of it is pretty so we &#8211; it also has that pattern logo though so I think the idea behind this part at least is that you can hide the PSU so you got a pretty design to kind of still see it it&#8217;s rate review its go ahead and open this thing up this bad boy so this is held on with screws no fancy avalanches on this one but again this is uh this is more of a budget option for this kind of thing I think it&#8217;s right now it&#8217;s like just under 90 bucks on nuoc that&#8217;s where this one came from it&#8217;s the only place I could find it available so boys have that fun risk of dropping it when you undo it it&#8217;s got a little ledge to sit on but what happened every time that I take you know laughs like homos dropped it this is a habit a alpha might win his extra fan bonus stuff it&#8217;s not it&#8217;s just like some cable back but let&#8217;s see if you can see in here we have the one fan that it comes with its RGB apparently I asked online I&#8217;m like hey is anybody know what this fan is I want to get a few more no one has any idea apparently it&#8217;s not released and I think if you look closely you can actually see maybe I&#8217;ll get a close-up shot there is a big metallic skier logo on the fan so it&#8217;s their brand I was thinking it might just be like a fan tax brand that they rebranded to metallic gear I couldn&#8217;t find any fan text fans so I have no idea what it is and I can&#8217;t buy any fans to match it so that&#8217;s really stupid like you would think I mean it&#8217;s not like it just yesterday it&#8217;s been me on that open up this is an unboxing in the world apparently around here with this so you got hang on hey they are there [Music] they stay on so you don&#8217;t lose them I don&#8217;t know what you call this what do we got here we&#8217;ve got some metallic gear branded cable management so it&#8217;s real premium stuff here uh well I mean it&#8217;s nice you know you got some hard drive mouse kickin off you got room for three SSDs here gonna be honest I mean this is obviously a TV stuff maybe well find out so um that does that this is a plug for your career front io you&#8217;ve got two USB 3 ports as well as a headphone and audio jack I believe yep and an indicator light oh no this is the RGB so that should be exciting I&#8217;m hoping to get some hard to be fans but yeah those things are crazy expensive so I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re gonna have compatibility to work with the aura sync and all that stuff but uh that&#8217;s pretty much it for this case unboxing I hope you guys have enjoyed it at least a little bit what we doing some some build videos in this thing in fact we&#8217;re gonna be doing like at least one build video because we only got part you on computer so nothing too fancy but it&#8217;s gonna be pretty sweet so I&#8217;m excited to show that to you guys there should be a subscribe button and and it&#8217;s over here there&#8217;s a bell get the bell on anybody yeah anyway hopefully you guys liked it subscribe we&#8217;ve got a website computer station nation.com just getting started with that so head on over there see if you like anything I&#8217;ll let me know in the comments if you have something specific you wanted to see in regards to this case or something else in general that&#8217;s it for now</p>
