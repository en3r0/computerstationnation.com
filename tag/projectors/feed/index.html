<h2>Factors to Consider When Buying a Projector</h2>



<p>Before you jump the gun and buy your very own gaming projector, know first the factors that you need to check. Don&#8217;t go in misinformed and check specs carefully so you will get the most out of your purchase.</p>



<h3>DLP VS LCD</h3>



<p>Know what better suits you as there are two kinds of projectors; DLP and LCD. DLP projectors use a light source along with a color wheel and a chip that includes some microscopic tilting mirrors. On the other hand, LCD projectors use a light source that passes light into 3 LCD Chips in order to project images</p>



<h3>Display Performance</h3>



<p>Of course, the most important factor is how good is its display. One important thing to check is color reproduction. Make sure that the color is accurate and sharp to ensure better rendering. Contrast ratio&nbsp;is also important as it supplements brightness and balances the picture. Pixel Density&nbsp;which is also known as display resolution is critical too.</p>



<h3>Brightness</h3>



<p>Make sure that light output is enough for optimum performance.&nbsp; Remember that poor light will result in muddy and soft display. Check the&nbsp;ANSI Lumens&nbsp;rating carefully.</p>



<h3>Portability</h3>



<p>Portability is important, not just for easy transport but for fuss-free installation as well.</p>



<h3>Inputs</h3>



<p>Before buying make sure that it supports the device that you are planning to hook it up to. To be on the safe side make sure to invest in a multi-platform projector to maximize its value.</p>



<h2>Wrap-Up</h2>



<p>Gaming is more enjoyable with better equipment. However, not everyone is blessed with deep pockets or the willingness to splurge. Then again, that doesn&#8217;t mean that low budgets mean low quality. Never settle for less and always be critical in the specs and features.</p>



<p>Make sure to read this guide and deliberate in what product resonates to your needs more. After all, there are loads of options out there if you know where to look.</p>
