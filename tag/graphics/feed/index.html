<p>The amount of power consumed by a graphics card is tantamount to the quality of its graphics performance and adaptability to high-end games. A graphics card is a very vital component of a <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> system that determines the quality of graphics displayed on a computer system but like every other component, it needs to be powered before it can function effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The amount of power supplied to a graphics card determines the quality of its graphics performance and that is why the right power connector must be paired with the right slot to ensure optimum performance and to prevent instances of fire hazard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All motherboards come with a prebuilt graphics power connector but in some cases, this power connector might not be enough to cater to high-end games, hence the need for a secondary graphics power connector to boost the graphics performance of the graphics processing unit.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Graphics Card Power Connectors</h2>







<h3>PCI-e connector</h3>



<p>Almost all graphics cards come with a PCIe X16 power connector that functions with the PCIe slot to provide 75 watts of power that is suitable to power mid-range graphics cards and transfer data between a motherboard and a graphics card.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PCI-e slot functions as a primary power connector and all external graphics card power connectors have to be connected to it for a smooth transfer of power and graphics performance to the computer.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<h3>6-Pin Power Connector</h3>
</div>
</div>



<p>A 6-pin graphics card power connector is a secondary power connector that is powerful enough to supply up to 75 watts of power to the graphics card while complementing the 75 watts of power produced by the PCIe slots to make a total of 150 watts. It is suitable for a graphics card that requires more than 75 watts of power.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>8-pin connector</h3>



<p>This graphics card power connector can deliver 150 watts of power to the graphics card on its own. It can be paired with the PCI-e X16 power connector as a secondary source of power to the graphics card, it produces a total of 225 watts, which makes it most suitable for a high-end graphics card that requires more than 150 watts of power.</p>



<h3>12-pin connector</h3>



<p>&nbsp;This power connector is highly compatible with Nvidia&#8217;s RTX 3000 series and it provides a high amount of power which makes it suitable for highly demanding games and applications. It is almost the same size with an 8-pin power connector and it is equally compatible with two 6-pin adapter cables.</p>



<p>It can support up to 500 watts of power via 18AWG and 600 watts of power via 16WAG. Its ability to generate more power than the 8-pin power connectors while taking up the same amount t of space as an 8-pin power connector makes it suitable for transferring data and aiding the graphics performance of high-end games.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Low-end graphics card draws their power from the PCIe X16 slot while higher graphics card needs a secondary source of power such as a 6-pin power connector or/and an 8-pin power connector to increase the power consumption and performance of graphics cards. Some graphics cards come with a 6-pin and an 8-pin connector, while some come with two or three 6pin or 8-pin connectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if the power unit on your graphics card does not have a 6-pin or an 8-pin power connector to complement the PCIe, you can use either a 6-pin converter or an 8-pin converter/ adapter cable to power the graphics card.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The importance of graphics cards in a computer system can not be overemphasized but then a single graphics card is sometimes not enough to cater extensively to the graphics performance of most high-end games as they rely heavily on their graphics processing unit, hence the need for powerful graphics settings.</p>



<p>As a way out, technology has decided to grace our <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> with configurations that support multiple GPUs to produce higher game settings and system performance. These graphics card configurations present themselves as SLI owned by Nvidia and Crossfire owned by AMD.</p>



<h2>Difference Between SLI and Crossfire&nbsp;SLI</h2>







<h3><strong>Nvidia</strong></h3>



<p>Scalable Link Interface popularly known as SLI is produced by Nvidia as a multiple graphics card solution that supports identical graphics cards from different vendors to function effectively while being paired with an SLI bridge. SLI requires that the cards used must have the same graphics processor with similar memory configurations, although they can have a different clock speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Effective utilization of SLI requires a&nbsp; configuration that requires motherboard manufacturers to pay a licensing fee for motherboard certification and this makes it more expensive when compared to crossfire.&nbsp; It supports windowed and full-screen mode and can support up to four graphics cards from different vendors with different clock speeds.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Crossfire</h3>



<p>Crossfire is AMD&#8217;s solution to a multi-GPU setup that supports different graphics cards within the same architecture by connecting them via a PCI-e. It supports different graphics cards within the same architectural generation, different clock speeds, and different memory configurations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crossfire does not require motherboard certification, and it offers better compatibility with different motherboard settings and requirements. This flexibility is what makes it a preferred choice for a lot of motherboard manufacturers, in addition to its support for APUs and&nbsp; GPUs in CPUs to upgrade graphics performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It only supports full-screen mode and employs a split frame rendering mode which is known as scissors to complement its alternate frame rendering by assigning different frames to each card to enable it to work effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>SLI and Crossfire are built to allow multiple graphics cards to work together in a single system to deliver more GPU power. Both graphics card configurations allow the computer system to split and alternate the load of processing graphics-related data between multiple cards to help it render more frames within a short period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These multi-GPU solutions are great configurations for multiple graphics card settings but they have things that set them apart from the other. Despite their unique differences, they are excellent in amplifying graphics performance and quality, and knowing what makes them different will help you choose between both of them.</p>



<p>SLI and Crossfire are multi-GPU solutions that are designed to support multiple graphics cards in the same computer system. They are both ideals for utilizing more than one graphics card to deliver an enhanced gaming experience, better frame rates, higher resolutions, and new technological advancement in computer configurations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many do not know the difference between <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> graphics card GPU, iGPU, and APU and so terms are sometimes used incorrectly. In this guide, we will show the difference between Graphics Card GPU IGPU and APU.</p>



<p><br>The main difference from an IGPU is the way the CPU and GPU can transfer information. The chip has the CPU and GPU on the same single die as some intel CPUs, but AMD’s APUs support Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA), allowing the CPU and GPU to be on the same bus, which allows for smooth communication. The steps are reduced for each instruction as the memory and tasks are shared.<br></p>



<p>So the acronyms APU, CPU, GPU, and iGPU are defined below:<br></p>



<p>APU: Accelerated Processing Unit.<br>CPU: Central Processing Unit.<br>GPU: Graphics Processing Unit.<br>GPU: Integrated Graphics Processing Unit, or integrated graphics processing unit.</p>



<h2>What are the differences and why are they so-called?</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the basics, the CPU. The CPU is the processor of a computer, the “brain” in charge of carrying out all the operations, and controls everything in the system.</p>



<h2>Graphics Card</h2>



<p>Graphics cards take many heavy graphical tasks away from the CPU and provide it to the GPU, where the GPU can use its own ram and processing power.</p>



<p>The GPU is a kind of processor that the dedicated graphics cards incorporate. Unlike the CPUs, its set of instructions and internal components are optimized for graphics. Although a CPU can perform most operations (not all) of a GPU and vice versa, since they are not optimized for this, the performance is substantially lower when operating the other&#8217;s functions, which is why they are two separate components.</p>



<p><br>GPU, also know as a graphics processing unit, is a processor designed for graphical computation. It manipulates and alters memory to create images in a frame buffer that can then be sent as video to a display. Many embedded systems use GPUs to take advantage of the highly efficient manipulation of computer graphics. This includes but is not limited to: PCs, Phones, and Game Consoles.</p>



<p>The term GPU came about from Sony in 1994 when referring to the PlayStation’s GPU. Nvidia later popularized in 1999, where they marketed the GeForce 256 as “the world’s first GPU” and went on to create the GeForce Series Graphics Cards. Like a CPU, a GPU requires its own memory and works with other components to complete scheduled tasks.</p>



<h2><strong>CPU-vs-GPU</strong></h2>



<p>Some CPUs can incorporate a graphics processor in the same die, called GPU, which is nothing but an integrated GPU, but it works independently. In this way, it is achieved that without the need for a dedicated graphics card, we can view the content on a monitor, although in these cases, the performance is quite low due to the physical limitations they have.</p>



<h2>Pros And Cons Of GPU</h2>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li> Fast in graphics-related and massively parallel jobs.</li><li>Can take on more demanding tasks.</li><li>Are excellent for matrix operations.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li> GPUs fail on branch prediction.</li><li> GPU can’t drive itself, needs a CPU to be controlled.</li></ul>



<h2>Intel-iGPU</h2>



<p>The memory is taken from your typical desktop ram. Because of this, faster dual-channel memory always works better with GPUs. Ports are obtained from your motherboard, and cooling is taken from your CPU Cooler.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Having an IGPU will usually always be slower than a dedicated GPU as it has to obtain and share resources from other components. Furthermore, GPUs tend not to be as fast as dedicated GPUs, which cause lower overall performance.AMD Accelerated Processing Unit or APU is a type of IGPU. AMD launched the APU in 2011 and is still used today.</p>
