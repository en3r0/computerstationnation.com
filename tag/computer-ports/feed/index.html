<p>Desktop PCs are built with different types of posts that sustain their functionality and enhance their performance and suitability for accomplishing different tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, regardless of how well equipped the desktop is, it still needs to be paired with a monitor to aid graphic, text, and visual representation of the software installed into the computer. </p>



<p>One of the most basic processors that support the effective and efficient performance of the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> is the graphics processing unit that requires a graphics card to function effectively.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Two Leading Graphics Card Brand</h2>



<p>The two leading brands for graphics cards are Nvidia and AMD and over time, they have produced different forms of graphics cards that are designed to synchronize frame rates for a smooth visual representation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monitors are designed to function with a dedicated graphics card that is inserted via graphics ports that make it suitable for games and visual content. In most situations, the desktop PC or monitor is built with only one PCI Express x16 slot which is built specifically to accommodate a graphics card.</p>



<h2><strong>Primary And Secondary Slots</strong></h2>



<p>Other times, the motherboard is built with two PCIe slots that are regarded as the primary and secondary slots and although they are built with similar features, they perform differently. In such instances, the graphics card should be inserted into the primary PCIe slot because it requires little or no configurations to become effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primary PCIe slot is most times designed to be longer and in some instances, it is identified through a text indicator on the motherboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, if youâ€™re a gamer, designer, entertainer or regardless of the type of work that you need the computer/ monitor to execute, a single graphics card port is enough to cater to the job</p>
