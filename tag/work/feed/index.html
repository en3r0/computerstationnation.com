<h2>Things to Consider When Purchasing a Laptop</h2>



<h3>Battery</h3>



<p>Irrespective of the purpose that you want your laptop to serve, its usability, and performance is a determinant of its battery capacity and that is why you should only opt for laptops that have a battery capacity that can last for nothing less than five hours. A long-lasting battery will help you work effectively without worrying about the laptop shutting down while you‚Äôre in the middle of an important job, game, or video.</p>



<h3>Ports</h3>



<p>Input ports serve as a source of connecting secondary devices that aid the functionality of your laptop and the number of ports that you have also determine the number of devices that can be connected to it. While you should consider the number of ports, you should consider the type of ports that your laptop is equipped with as this will determine the functionality of each port and how it can be adapted to aid your performance.</p>



<h3>Audio</h3>



<p>A good laptop should have a decent audio Technology that is designed to produce great sounds that are suitable for games and conferences. While you might want to support its audio quality with external speakers, the built-in speakers should be greater towards producing an outstanding audio quality that is highly optimized for different uses.</p>



<h3>Size</h3>



<p>A major feature that has become synonymous to laptops is their portable size.&nbsp;There are different sizes of monitors with the biggest ranging between 15-17 inches. Depending on your preference, and purpose, it is important that you get a laptop size that you‚Äôre not just comfortable working with but also presents a clear picture and also easy to take along with you wherever work takes you.</p>



<h3>Resolution and Display</h3>



<p>&nbsp;4k and 5k resolutions are the biggest things to have happened to computer resolutions and while 5k is mostly found in some Mac, 4k resolution can be found in some laptops. However, you won‚Äôt be needing that much of a screen resolution either for your games, graphics, or spreadsheet and data presentation. A 1080p resolution is great for displaying images with clarity and attention to detail. It is suitable for different purposes and is sometimes paired with 250-350 nits of brightness for clarity and a seamless visual experience.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column">
<h3>Price</h3>
</div>
</div>



<p>There‚Äôs no doubt that most high-end laptops are pricey and this is mostly because of the high definition features that it employs to ensure excellent performance and efficiency while you employ it to handle tasks. Sometimes, when searching for laptops, our search options are narrowed by the price options being presented but you‚Äôll agree with me that everything good comes with a little extra price and this is very true with laptops. If you can afford it, get a well-built and high-performance laptop because they are durable, reliable, and more functional for different purposes.</p>



<h3>RAM</h3>



<p>A laptop‚Äôs RAM is one of its most important components that underscores its performance and functionality because the faster the RAM, the faster the rate at which memory transfers information to other components. It also determines the speed of your processor and for best results,&nbsp; nothing less than an 8Gb RAM is preferred for handling different purposes with efficiency and outright excellence in its performance.</p>



<h3>Storage</h3>



<p>In addition to the RAM, you should also consider the secondary storage capacity when purchasing a laptop. This complements the RAM and promotes fluidity in multitasking as well as the smooth operation of new and already existing applications on the laptop.</p>



<h3>Graphic Cards</h3>



<p>A good graphic card can improve the performance of the computer to a very large extent by ensuring a lag-free, tear-free, and stutter-free video session for your games and movies as well as promoting easy and smooth multitasking in different applications at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Operating System</h3>



<p>The type of operating system employed by your computer will determine how you interact via its user interface.&nbsp;While there are different operating systems such as Windows, Mac, and Chrome, the most popular and widely used operating system is Windows (with its latest development being the Windows 10 operating system).&nbsp; Although your choice of an operating system might determine your preference, Windows and Mac are the most widely used and they have proven to be highly efficient with a friendly user interface that makes them easy to use for different purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Processors</h3>



<p>This is also another basic feature that can influence the performance of your laptop if you do not pick it correctly. Different types of processors have been developed over time and they are generally geared towards the effective performance of your laptop. Laptops with Intel Core Processors have proven to be highly efficient for running multiple apps simultaneously without lag or tear when paired with good graphics cards and that is why it is highly recommended that your preferred processor choice should not be narrowed towards this angle.</p>



<h3>Webcam</h3>



<p>A webcam is not a basic feature when searching for a good laptop but this fact is also dependent on the purpose for which you‚Äôre purchasing a laptop. If you‚Äôre in the market for a gaming laptop, you can forgo this feature but if you want a business laptop, then you should opt for a laptop that has a built-in webcam to aid video conferencing for business growth and adaptability to the latest events.</p>



<h3>Other things to consider</h3>



<p>Apart from the above factors, other questions come to the mind of a lot of people when searching for a laptop, and the most common questions include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Is a gaming laptop more suitable for the task at hand? </li><li>Does the laptop have good reviews?</li><li>How often will I use this laptop?</li><li>Is the laptop touch sensitive?</li><li>Does the weight make it easy to carry around?</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Knowledge they say, is power and when you‚Äôre equipped with information on the things to consider while searching for a laptop, finding the right one for you won‚Äôt be so much of a task.</p>



<p>I hope that this article provided useful hints that can sustain a fruitful search for a laptop that can cater to different purposes.

<p>Gaming computers can definitely be used for work. They often contain high end components (processor and graphics card) that preform well on many different types of tasks &#8211; not just gaming.</p>



<p>In fact, many popular YouTuber&#8217;s benchmark their gaming rigs with productivity software along with games to get a better idea of their performance.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="467" src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaming-computer-used-for-work.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-282" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaming-computer-used-for-work.jpg 700w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaming-computer-used-for-work-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption>That gaming keyboard can type regular words too!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Difference Between a Gaming Computer and a Regular Computer<br></h2>



<p>As I mentioned, the main difference between a Gaming PC and a Regular PC is in the components. <strong>Mainly the GPU</strong> (Graphics Processing Unit) is going to be more powerful.</p>



<p>This more powerful Graphics Card (GPU) is going to allow you to run games, which are visually more demanding than other tasks.</p>



<p>You also might have other parts which are all around better &#8211; a faster CPU (Central Processing Unit), more RAM (Random Access Memory), and a bigger HDD (Hard Drive Device).</p>



<p>The last thing that can be a big difference between a normal computer and gaming computer is the Monitor. Specifically the <strong>monitor refresh rate</strong>.</p>



<p>The refresh rate of a <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/computer-monitors-for-gaming/">gaming monitor</a> can allow for a smoother visual experience. It has become more popular lately and is even advertised on gaming laptops. It becomes very serious as you look toward the world of eSports.<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="454" src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/esports-gaming-computers-action.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-283" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/esports-gaming-computers-action.jpg 700w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/esports-gaming-computers-action-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption>eSports in action. League of Legends maybe?</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Can I Use a Gaming PC for Normal Use?</h2>



<p>Of course! Your mom can browse Pinterest till her hearts content on these things. You can also do anything else you would do on a regular computer.<br></p>



<h2>What else can you do with a Gaming Computer?</h2>



<p>With a powerful machine like most gaming computers, your possibilities are endless. Here are a few tasks a powerful Gaming PC could be used for:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Video Editing</strong> &#8211; Rendering out scenes can take a lot of processing power.</li><li><strong>3D Modeling</strong> &#8211; Another task that can take a lot of power to render.</li><li><strong>Scientific Computations</strong> &#8211; I am not super familiar with this one, but I know they can be used for it.</li><li><strong>Photo Editing</strong> &#8211; Some of the heavier tasks will improve a ton with a better computer.</li><li><strong>Programing</strong> &#8211; Compile times can be cut down a lot with a better machine.</li><li><strong>CAD (Computer Aided Design)</strong> &#8211; Similar to the 3D modeling.<br></li></ul>
