<p>A lot of people readily store programs on an SSD storage device but with time, they realize that an SSD is built with limited storage capacity and the large number of programs saved on it will slow down its performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, they turn to the next viable option that poses as an HDD storage device but sometimes, they programs with difficulties in transferring these programs to an HDD storage location.</p>



<p>You can&nbsp; mitigate the tough discomfort thrown at your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer </a>by a solid-state drive ( SSD), by following these methods of transferring programs to a Hard disk drive ( HDD)&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Moving Programs From SSD to HDD</h2>



<h2>Copying</h2>



<p>Most operating systems do not recommend dragging, or copying programs because some programs might not run well when moved to a new storage device. However, because of the limited storage capacity of SSD’s, moving programs to HDD is just inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first step to successfully move files is to back them up first with a reliable backup software to prevent complete loss of programs in instances where the moving program in the new location is not supported on the operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To ensure a smooth transfer of program files and ensure that they work well, it is advisable to log in to the operating system as an administrator, before copying the files to the new storage location.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>Activating a symbolic link command or using software to move programs from SSD to HDD is highly suitable for different kinds of programs on different operating systems. This can be easily done by changing the properties of such programs such as their bits ( Program files exist in different bits such as 32, 64, and 86 bits) and moving them to an HDD storage device. </p>



<p>One of the benefits of moving programs from SSD to HDD is that it eliminates the need to re-install these programs on their new storage location. After successfully moving the selected programs, you can choose to create a folder on the desktop for the moved programs to serve as a shortcut to easily access them.</p>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Moving complex data such as programs can be easy if you have the right support and I hope that this article was helpful for the task&nbsp;</p>

<p>SSD’s are well known for their speed and enhanced performance of the operating system and the applications installed on the computer but it is not all rosy especially with its storage capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite their outstanding speed, they are not an ideal storage location for files because of their poor storage capacity which gets full in no time and thus leading to the very same thing that you’ve been avoiding all along – slow performance.</p>



<p>To sustain the speed of your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer&#8217;s</a> SSD, you need to pair it with an HDD. HDDs are excellent storage devices that support heavy-duty files in large volumes. They are easily affordable and function excellently with an SSD in a computer as an alternative storage device for your files.</p>







<h2>Moving Files From SSD to HDD</h2>



<p>There are different ways that you employ to move files from SSD to HDD and they include</p>



<h2>Dragging</h2>



<p>Selecting and dragging them from their previous location on the SSD and dropping them on a new location saved on the HDD</p>



<h2>Copy and Paste</h2>



<p>Copying the files from the previous location on SSD and pasting them in a new location on the HDD can be done by right clicking on the desired file that wants to be moved, activating the copy option, creating a folder on the new location, and pasting it there. The files saved on the previous SSD location have to be deleted to avoid having duplicate files so that the computer can recognize a single file.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>When transferring a large number of files at the same time, it is advisable to use a software application that supports the moving of files to a new hard drive. This software allows the quick moving of large files to different locations in the computer. This feature is sustained by its strong compatibility with windows and different storage devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, create a folder on your chosen software. Choose a new storage location for saving the files ( HDD) and save the files. The files and subsequent ones will be automatically saved on the new storage location which is the HDD.</p>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The copy and paste, and then drag and drop features are only suitable for moving a small number of files. In other words, when moving a large amount of files, they should be moved in bits moved through a software after the HDD has been set to an NTFS format.</p>

<p>When buying a desktop computer, there are a series of processors that are integrated to enhance the general performance of the computer. Some are functional for graphical representation and others process the overall performance of the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a>. </p>



<p>Some of the core processors built into a computer include a GPU, CPU, and APU. The functions of these processing units are often misplaced for the other but they function collectively for a smooth computer performance&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Graphics Processing Unit</h2>



<p>The Graphics Processing Unit is a programmable electronic circuit card that is designed to perform high volume and repetitive computation that helps it to process images at a very fast rate. </p>



<p>It functions as an interface on the graphics card’s board that renders the graphic user interface on an operating system for graphical applications such as animation, video editing, image files, 3D modeling, and other professional software that requires detailed graphical illustration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is designed for quick image processing, and functions by transferring files into frame rates. Its speed is usually measured in Megahertz and it is designed with its RAM to store temporary data which enables it to function with the aid of a well-optimized graphics card with the most popular brand being Nvidia and AMD.</p>



<p>It comes in different sizes and employs different cooling solutions that make it adaptable for laptops, casual computer users, and gamers. It can be integrated with either a CPU or a motherboard which makes it removable and upgradeable. It can also be in a dedicated format that helps it to function via a PCIe slot with the motherboard.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Central Processing Unit</h2>



<p>Popularly known as the brain of a computer that gives a command to every component, the central processing unit can be regarded as one of the basic components of a computer that determines its overall performance. It is built with tons of transistors and multiple cores that implement basic logical operations such as opening programs, loading an operating system, and general multitasking.</p>



<p>Its speed is measured in gigahertz and by default, its speed determines the overall performance of the computer. It is built as a general-purpose interface whose speed and intelligence determine the overall performance of the computer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is available in different variants, with the most popular being AMD, Intel, and Apple. However, most modern CPUs come with integrated GPUs but a GPU has more processing power than a CPU with an integrated graphics card.</p>



<h2>Accelerated Processing Unit</h2>



<p>The best way to describe an Accelerated Processing Unit otherwise known as APU is a jack of all trades. It is built with both CPU and GPU cores on a single die which makes it able to perform the tasks of a GPU and a CPU. It is a hybrid of a CPU and GPU processor that is built by AMD to function as a general-purpose processor with a faster transfer of data, increased performance, and a cost and a power-efficient alternative to a GPU.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>&nbsp;GPU is ideal for generating smooth motion pictures with graphical contents for virtual reality and it is faster than the CPU for executing tasks that require multi-threading,&nbsp; However, the general performance of the computer is processed by the CPU.&nbsp; They function collectively for a smooth computer user experience</p>

<p>Storage devices are highly important for the overall functioning and performance of a computer because it determines the volume of files that can be stored and the speed at which tasks can be executed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are different types of <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer </a>storage devices and the most popular is the Solid State Drive which is commonly called SSD and the Hard Disk Drive which is commonly called HDD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These storage devices are built with powerful control chips and other distinct features that make them perform differently. However, they are both suitable as storage devices but their performance is what makes them distinct.</p>







<h2>Why SSD Are So Popular?</h2>



<p>One of the most popular amounts of storage memory available on SSD is a 256GB SSD. However, for this discussion, we’ll be comparing it with a 1TB HDD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An HDD is a very important component of a computer that stores a large amount of data. In comparison, It has more storage features when compared to an SSD which makes it suitable for storing files, audios, videos, and images. Cost-wise, it is also more economical than an SSD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, SSD’s have more speed and this makes it a preferred choice than an HDD. It employs more transfer speed for opening and running applications which makes it more reliable than an HDD for computer performance.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Why HDD Is Considered As an Alternative To SSD</strong>?</h2>



<p>Narrowing our comparison, a 256GB has lesser storage capacity than a 1TB HDD, although a 256GB and a 1TB HDD can both store data and start an operating system, SSD’s are more preferred because of their faster performance when compared to an HDD that has more storage features. They both have similar storage capacity but a 256GB SSD performs at a very fast speed when compared to a 1TB SSD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, recent technology has created an SSHD which is a hybrid of an SSD and an HDD that is mostly found in laptops. This storage device has a larger cache and a response time that is a few times faster than an HDD, although not as fast as an HDD. In conclusion, if you are building or buying a computer, you can go with both of them if you can afford it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A workstation and a desktop PC are two popular types of <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computers</a> that are a bit similar in appearance but distinct in features and performance. The names of these two computers are often used in place of the other and sometimes, people think that they are built with similar features to perform in similar conditions. </p>



<p>Although the name of these two computers is used interchangeably, it is important to point out the differences between both computers that makes them suitable for different tasks.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Workstations</h2>



<p>Workstations are high-end computers that are meant for more power-intensive and commercial applications. It mostly integrates enterprise-level processor such as Xeon processors that supports lots of cores, diverse memory slots that supports multiple high-quality graphics cards to accelerate the rendering time of the computer&#8217;s frame rate, and large RAM ( most workstations are compatible with ECC RAMs) which makes it suitable for applications that require complex data manipulation and logistical operations.</p>



<p>Unlike desktop PCs, workstations are mostly used by big organizations for activities such as media ( audio and video) development, CAD drawing, commercial applications, scientific research, extensive mathematics, analyst, designers, animations, high-end technological issues, and other applications that require a high level of processing power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The structural specification of a workstation requires no tools to access its easily upgradeable components, plus they can be sustained by a secondary source of power supply which makes them highly suitable for activities that require continuous workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course with such high-end features and specifications comes a befitting price that cannot be easily afforded by all.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Desktop PCs</h2>



<p>Unlike a workstation, a desktop PC is suitable for general use with applications that do not require high processing power. It is suitable for executing daily tasks such as games, web browsing, designing undemanding graphics,&nbsp; businesses, and window-based applications.&nbsp; </p>



<p>It is usually powered by simple processors such as Intel and AMD and in most instances, they function on a Windows operating system which happens to be the most popular and user-friendly operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A desktop PC does not require a mainstream ISV certification or very large memory capacity. They also do not support SCSI, HDD, or Raid which makes them well suited for games, small businesses, and home use. It is more affordable when compared to a workstation, and this makes it more popular among gamers, businesses, and office users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Desktop PCs are built with different types of posts that sustain their functionality and enhance their performance and suitability for accomplishing different tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, regardless of how well equipped the desktop is, it still needs to be paired with a monitor to aid graphic, text, and visual representation of the software installed into the computer. </p>



<p>One of the most basic processors that support the effective and efficient performance of the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> is the graphics processing unit that requires a graphics card to function effectively.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Two Leading Graphics Card Brand</h2>



<p>The two leading brands for graphics cards are Nvidia and AMD and over time, they have produced different forms of graphics cards that are designed to synchronize frame rates for a smooth visual representation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monitors are designed to function with a dedicated graphics card that is inserted via graphics ports that make it suitable for games and visual content. In most situations, the desktop PC or monitor is built with only one PCI Express x16 slot which is built specifically to accommodate a graphics card.</p>



<h2><strong>Primary And Secondary Slots</strong></h2>



<p>Other times, the motherboard is built with two PCIe slots that are regarded as the primary and secondary slots and although they are built with similar features, they perform differently. In such instances, the graphics card should be inserted into the primary PCIe slot because it requires little or no configurations to become effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The primary PCIe slot is most times designed to be longer and in some instances, it is identified through a text indicator on the motherboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, if you’re a gamer, designer, entertainer or regardless of the type of work that you need the computer/ monitor to execute, a single graphics card port is enough to cater to the job</p>

<p>Cleaning a <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> is not just about blowing off dust and scrubbing with a clean cloth to make it look neat to onlookers. How are the internal components fairing, do you clean them at all or you probably think they never get dirty and so don’t need cleaning, or maybe you think that there’s a self-cleaning agent built into them.</p>



<p> I’m sorry to disappoint you but those buddies need cleaning too, especially that processor that to a large extent, determines your computer&#8217;s graphics performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cleaning a graphics card is not regarded as important when cleaning a computer&#8217;s internal components and because of your constant neglect, your computer&#8217;s graphics, and frame rendering performance is being affected. Whether you’ve noticed or not, you don’t have to wait till it gets very bad, so pick up an antistatic strap, with your tools, and let’s do some cleaning.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>The Tools</h2>



<p>The tools needed for cleaning a graphics card includes a screwdriver ( a screwdriver set will be a preferable option that offers unlimited access to different types of screws), a dust blower, Isopropyl alcohol, a cleaning cloth, and a thermal paste. Ensure that you do not use any material that will leave residue on the graphics card and get ready to clean in these easy steps.</p>



<h2>The Process</h2>



<ul><li>Unplug the computer and disconnect the graphics card from the motherboard. </li><li>Disassemble the graphics card with a screwdriver and disintegrate the reinforcement chip.</li><li> Disassemble the fan from the port that connects it to a circuit board and Remove the screws holding the plastic cover onto the metal portion of the heat sink. </li><li>Clean the fan to remove dust by using a dust blower, clean the heatsink too by using a dust blower.</li><li> Disassemble all parts of the graphics card and clean with alcohol and a swab. You can choose to clean with a dry cleaning cloth or a cotton swab that provides easy access to all parts of the graphics card. </li><li>Apply thermal paste on all the unscrewed parts of the graphics processing unit and the team sink. </li><li>Affix the heat sink and the fan cover to the graphic processing unit as you prepare to reassemble the graphics card. </li><li>Apply a thin layer of thermal paste on all the unscrewed parts of the GPU to keep it cool and reassemble the graphics card. It is very important to test if the graphics cards, GPU and fans are in good working condition by turning on your computer to check the current performance. If the graphics card is not functioning properly, unscrew the graphics processing unit and reassemble it.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Razer is one of the brands that have a variety of devices that deliver excellent performance in games. Unlike most highly reputed brands, Razer also has devices on a budget platform and one of them is the Razer Seiren Mini microphone.
