<p>A lot of computer users work late into the night or early morning. Thus, their workspace has to be <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/lighting/best-monitor-backlight/">properly illuminated</a> with a portable secondary source of lighting to help them get through. </p>



<p>Still, after a while, they complain of eye strain, headache, and other eye-related problems. All of their complaints are related, which brings to mind the big question; did they use the right light?</p>



<p>Apart from providing adequate illumination for your texts and other computer works, the right kind of light is void of glare and flicker to eliminate eye-related problems, gradually becoming a second means of identifying ardent computer users. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Listen, we have all sat in a bad office chair and you don&#8217;t have to pretend the one you are sitting in now is without issues.</p>



<p><a href="https://computerstationnation.com/chairs/">A good office chair</a> helps you to stay comfortable when working. It provides a soft surface to sit on, arm rests, lumbar support and enough adjustability to guarantee your well being throughout the day. An office chair is a very important part of your furniture! Unfortunately, it can develop problems due to many years of use, damage or error during the manufacturing process. Here are some office chair problems and how you can solve them.</p>







<h2>Weak or worn out chair cushion</h2>



<p>The seat cushion is one of the most important parts of your office chair because it provides a pliable surface for you to sit on while working. There are many office chairs that are equipped with visually attractive chair cushions upholstered in glistening faux leather. They look plump, soft and durable but do not hold up well after long hours of usage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may find that the seat cushion stays compressed even after you stand up from it. If you notice that a seat cushion stays compressed after you stand up, it is likely that it will get worn out quickly after repeated usage. In situations of extreme damage, you may find that your office chair leans to one side because of an improperly fitted seat cushion.</p>



<p>The best way to avoid problems arising from office chair seat cushions is to pick a proper one during purchase. There are some strategies that you can rely on to select a good quality office chair at the furniture store. Kneel upon an edge of the seat cushion and if you don&#8217;t feel the metal frame underneath, that specific chair will last for a long time. You can also sit on it and stand up immediately. If the seat cushion regains firmness immediately, the office chair will maintain comfort for a long time. If you already have an office chair with a weak or worn out chair cushion, you can have it re-upholstered at a furniture store or automotive tuning shop.</p>



<h2>Sinking chair</h2>



<p>Do you usually feel as though the office chair is sinking slowly when you&#8217;re sitting in it? If you experience this problem, the culprit is its gas cylinder system. Also known as the gas lift or pneumatic cylinder, it is a common issue that arises with many office chairs. If this system ceases to operate as required, the pressure monitoring mechanism has failed. When this happens, you need to contact the chair&#8217;s manufacturer to request a replacement. Relying on its warranty is always a great strategy to fix this problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your office chair&#8217;s gas cylinder can start to malfunction if you exceed its weight rating. Majority of chairs have a rating of 225 pounds and if you tip the scales more than that, the gas cylinder system will experience challenges supporting your weight resulting in a sinking feeling during use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continual usage for many years can also affect the pneumatic system of your office chair in a negative way. If you use the chair for more than 10 years, its gas cylinder system will gradually begin to fail and sink whenever you are seated. If you feel the chair sinking after having used it for a decade or more, it is time for a replacement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Cracked or worn out castors </h2>



<p>Did you know that the standard castors on office chairs were developed for use on low-pile carpeting? As a matter of fact, office chair manufacturers insist that you utilize a chair mat for smooth movement that will not damage your floor. Standard castors are made of hardened plastic set over a steel frame. If your office has tiles, hardwood or laminate, always use a chair mat. Otherwise, the castors will scratch your floor and disfigure it.</p>



<p>After months of improper usage, the castors can crack or become unevenly worn out causing you to wonder why the office chair won&#8217;t stay up. When you&#8217;ve got worn out or damaged castors, have them replaced by a qualified office furniture technician. They can fit special castors which have rubberized edges that are designed for use on hard floors. Such castors will operate on a hard floor without damaging it and promote your comfort at the same time!</p>



<h2>Faulty recliner</h2>



<p>The latest office chair models are designed to recline on demand. By using a lever or set of buttons, you can make the backrest recline at angles ranging from 100 degrees to 180 degrees. In essence, your chair can recline until it lies flat like a bed. By using the recliner mechanism, you can control your level of comfort when using the chair. This gives you a chance to take a break and relax in-between your working hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the recliner mechanism is awesome, it can cease to operate as would be expected. The backrest can move erratically while reclining instead of shifting smoothly. Even worse, the recliner cogs can get stuck making the system completely inoperable. In an extreme case, the backrest can simply fail to maintain an optimum angle and fall back flat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you are faced with such a problem, a suitable solution is to consult the manufacturer. They will replace the reclining mechanism at no cost to you as long as your warranty is still valid. If the system fails after your warranty has already expired, a carpentry technician can help to repair it with the objective of restoring proper functionality.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Studies have shown that your level of comfort actively affects your productivity. With this in mind, it is essential to invest in an office chair that supports your back, shoulders and seat using the best materials available today. It should provide arm rests and the mechanisms necessary for multiple adjustments.</p>



<p>Many of our office chairs start out with brilliant performance but begin to get plagued by malfunction during use. We have covered some office chair problems above for you. Not only are they irritating, these issues can prove detrimental to your wellness. Thankfully, we have also suggested solutions to fix these problems. Follow our guidelines as you invest in an office chair to experience fulfillment every time you go to work!</p>

The company also throws in an additional set of Rollerblade Castors to smoothest possible swivels.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why You Might Want An Executive Office Chair</h2>



<p>When I was much younger, I asked my dad why he favored executive chairs to other regular office chairs. He said that there are two kinds of chairs; an executive office chair and others. He refused to give the “others” a name. Because to him, a chair that doesn’t speak about prestige and command power the way an executive chair does, has no business being in your office &#8211; especially if you’re the boss or you are nursing such an aspiration.</p>



<p>He refers to executive chairs as thrones of organizational power.&nbsp; Having grown up and worked in different organizations that brought together different kinds of people, I don’t think my dad was far from the truth, though I also learned more things that were quite different, they had one thing in common about executive chairs and that is authority.</p>



<p>I know you might be wondering why I think so highly of executive chairs but being synonymous with power, but it can also be a tough task picking the one that is right for you. A high-end executive chair should align with your body to provide the optimum result that you desire because employing your best assets and time for the best results should make you feel powerful.</p>

<p>This mic is going to be a great option for just getting something else going on besides the default mic on your headphones. It is USB and does not sport a lot of extra features. Plug it in and get the job done.</p>



<p>It is apparently Discord an Skype certified &#8211; whatever that means.</p>



<p>For those a bit more curious, it features 1 condenser with a Cardioid polar pattern.</p>

<p>This is a great mid-range microphone option. It has a few color options, and the nice stand from which it can detach and be more portable.

<p>This mic also includes a headphone port on the mic which allows for &#8220;zero-latency&#8221; monitoring, something that can be quite useful in a large variety of situations.</p>



<p>For the extra curious, this mic has 1 condenser with a Cardioid polar pattern.</p>

<p>One of the most popular microphones for streamers is the famed Blue Yeti. This could be overkill for some situations, but how would you know unless you buy one?</p>



<p>Having personally used one of these microphones for long amounts of time, I can assure you the quality is there for both the sound and the build of the physical microphone.</p>



<p>The only thing I can add here is if you are serious about this mic, you will want to pick up a Pop Shield to dampen those &#8220;P&#8221; sounds when you are speaking.</p>



<p>For the extra curious, this mic has 3 condensers with Cardioid, Bidirectional, Omnidirectional, and Stereo polar patterns. Epic.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VA464S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?amp;imprToken=grRJN8XPwIAcD7uyemVc3w&amp;slotNum=6&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=computersta08-20&amp;linkId=4bec4ea48ce6a3550737a90b152df713"><strong>Check it out on Amazon.</strong></a></p>



<h2>Common Microphone Definitions</h2>



<p><strong>Polar patterns</strong> &#8211; A polar pattern is how a microphone receives sound from a specific direction. A few types are listed below.</p>



<p><strong>Cardioid</strong> &#8211; Also Known As Unidirectional, is the most common type of polar pattern which has the most sensitivity at the front of the microphone, and the least sensitivity at the back.</p>



<p><strong>Bidirectional</strong> &#8211; Also Known As the Figure 8, this pattern picks up sound equally from the front and rear, but has the least sensitivity on the sides.</p>



<p><strong>Omnidirectional</strong> &#8211; This polar pattern picks up sounds equally from all directions (360-degrees).</p>



<p><strong>XLR</strong> &#8211; External Line Return is what XLR stands for. It is the way a mic outputs signal (aka hooks up to stuff). It is prized for producing the highest quality sound. You usually need some extra equipment to go with the mic to start using it.</p>



<p><strong>USB</strong> &#8211; Universal Serial Bus is what USB stands for (you knew that right?). This is going to hook straight into your computer, just like every other USB device you have ever used.</p>



<p><strong>Frequency response</strong> &#8211; This refers to the way a microphone responds to frequencies. For example if you have a lower frequency response, then your sound might come out more with more bass.</p>



<p><strong>Bit-Rate / Sample-Rate / Bit-Depth</strong> &#8211; These settings are something that you should be able to set from your computer and controls the quality of the recording. For most individuals 44.1 kHz at 16 bits is going to work fine. To read more in depth on this topic, <a href="https://resoundsound.com/sample-rate-bit-depth/">check out this article</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Shockmount</strong> &#8211; A shock mount is a device that holds the microphone and helps isolate it from any vibrations that it could potentially pickup from what ever it is attached to. This could help for example if your computer is sitting on your desk with the mic.</p>



<p><strong>Pop Shield</strong> &#8211; This is also known as a pop filter or pop screen or wind shield, and helps reduce the impact of strong air, or popping sounds, when bursts of air hit a microphone. Imagine your self saying the word &#8220;Pop&#8221; into a microphone with a lot of air behind it and how it would sound. This shield helps.</p>



<p><strong>Zero-Latency Monitoring</strong> &#8211; This is a feature on some microphones that allows you to have a separate line direct to your headphones, rather than  going through the computer and then to your head phones which would increase latency. There is a much more in depth article that explains this <a href="https://ask.audio/articles/how-to-achieve-true-zero-latency-monitoring-in-your-daw">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Gain</strong> &#8211; This is the ability to increase the signal of the microphone. It is a pretty standard feature.</p>



<p><strong>Condenser Microphone</strong> &#8211; Best for capturing voices. You will find these in most studios.</p>



<p><strong>Dynamic Microphone</strong> &#8211; Best for capturing loud sounds, probably not what you are looking for here.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>If you are looking for a general purpose all around microphone for your computer setup (working or gaming) then I think you are going to be pleased with the above options. However, if you are like me and need to explore every single option, then feel free to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=pc microphone&amp;crid=1SCTOCD2IC7HT&amp;sprefix=pc mi,aps,178&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_5&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=computersta08-20&amp;linkId=08beac994944a27b15c0a359913e8ad9">hop on over to Amazon and continue your search.</a></p>

<ol><li>A high resolution</li><li>A good even brightness</li></ol>



<p>With these two things and the right color settings to prevent strain on your eyes, you should be good to go.</p>



<h3>Is LED or LCD better for your eyes?</h3>



<p>LED backlit monitors are going to be better for your eyes than the back light tubes of yesteryear. Almost all monitors you buy these days are going to be LED backlit. You can <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/led-vs-lcd-tvs/">read more on that here</a></p>



<h3>What is the best size computer monitor?</h3>



<p>The best size of computer monitor is going to depend on your situation. Most monitors are between 21&#8243; inches and 24&#8243; inches and are in a widescreen format.</p>



<h3>Is a curved monitor good for office work?</h3>



<p>A curved monitor is supposed to be immersive. So if you are looking to get immersed in those spreadsheets, then here you go!</p>

<p>Whether you are using Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet software, a curved monitor can help you get immersed in your work. It may come down to personal taste in the end</p>



<h3>Is a curved monitor good for programming?</h3>



<p>A curved monitor can provide you with another level of immersion when it comes to programing. However, this really may come down to personal preference as to whether or not you think it is better than a flat panel monitor.</p>



<h3>What is the best 4k monitor for programming?</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dell-ultrasharp-U2715H-27-inch-4k-progaming-monitor.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-503" width="224" height="175" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dell-ultrasharp-U2715H-27-inch-4k-progaming-monitor.jpg 448w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dell-ultrasharp-U2715H-27-inch-4k-progaming-monitor-300x235.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px" /></figure></div>

<h3>Are dual monitors good for programming?</h3>



<p>This is another question that will vary depending on who you ask. Traditionally dual monitors have been seen as a must have for &#8220;increased productivity&#8221; by many. Now that UltraWide monitors exist, many are opting for one UltraWide rather than two regular monitors.</p>



<h3>Is a 144hz monitor good for programming?</h3>

<p>Gaming computers can definitely be used for work. They often contain high end components (processor and graphics card) that preform well on many different types of tasks &#8211; not just gaming.</p>



<p>In fact, many popular YouTuber&#8217;s benchmark their gaming rigs with productivity software along with games to get a better idea of their performance.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="467" src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaming-computer-used-for-work.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-282" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaming-computer-used-for-work.jpg 700w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gaming-computer-used-for-work-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption>That gaming keyboard can type regular words too!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Difference Between a Gaming Computer and a Regular Computer<br></h2>



<p>As I mentioned, the main difference between a Gaming PC and a Regular PC is in the components. <strong>Mainly the GPU</strong> (Graphics Processing Unit) is going to be more powerful.</p>



<p>This more powerful Graphics Card (GPU) is going to allow you to run games, which are visually more demanding than other tasks.</p>



<p>You also might have other parts which are all around better &#8211; a faster CPU (Central Processing Unit), more RAM (Random Access Memory), and a bigger HDD (Hard Drive Device).</p>



<p>The last thing that can be a big difference between a normal computer and gaming computer is the Monitor. Specifically the <strong>monitor refresh rate</strong>.</p>



<p>The refresh rate of a <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/monitors/computer-monitors-for-gaming/">gaming monitor</a> can allow for a smoother visual experience. It has become more popular lately and is even advertised on gaming laptops. It becomes very serious as you look toward the world of eSports.<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="454" src="http://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/esports-gaming-computers-action.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-283" srcset="https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/esports-gaming-computers-action.jpg 700w, https://computerstationnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/esports-gaming-computers-action-300x195.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption>eSports in action. League of Legends maybe?</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Can I Use a Gaming PC for Normal Use?</h2>



<p>Of course! Your mom can browse Pinterest till her hearts content on these things. You can also do anything else you would do on a regular computer.<br></p>



<h2>What else can you do with a Gaming Computer?</h2>



<p>With a powerful machine like most gaming computers, your possibilities are endless. Here are a few tasks a powerful Gaming PC could be used for:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Video Editing</strong> &#8211; Rendering out scenes can take a lot of processing power.</li><li><strong>3D Modeling</strong> &#8211; Another task that can take a lot of power to render.</li><li><strong>Scientific Computations</strong> &#8211; I am not super familiar with this one, but I know they can be used for it.</li><li><strong>Photo Editing</strong> &#8211; Some of the heavier tasks will improve a ton with a better computer.</li><li><strong>Programing</strong> &#8211; Compile times can be cut down a lot with a better machine.</li><li><strong>CAD (Computer Aided Design)</strong> &#8211; Similar to the 3D modeling.<br></li></ul>
