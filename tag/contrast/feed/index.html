<p>Modernization has gone digital and so have many activities in the world makes it close to impossible to not find a computer monitor in a modern office setting or a home. This upgrade in modernization is accompanied by a straining pressure on the most sensitive part of our body; our eyes.</p>







<h2>Way 1: Adjusting Brightness</h2>



<p>One of the best ways to reduce pressure and strains on our eyes is by knowing how to correctly set two important features in our monitor display; The brightness and contrast settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brightness and contrast is a very important setting in monitor display and while some monitors have an automatic setting for both,&nbsp; some require manual adjustment and this brings us to the question asked by active computer users: What is the correct brightness and contrast monitor setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is important to know the correct percentage of both display settings that are suitable for your eyes because working on a monitor that has the wrong setting for both features can put pressure on your eyes which in turn can lead to eye strains and other eye-related problems.</p>



<p>The brightness setting of a monitor is adjusted to get a uniform brightness setting between the monitor and the working environment. In other words, it is related to the lighting conditions of the environment and as such, it does not have a fixed setting but it is advisable to adjust the brightness setting to a 5% -95% shade difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the circumstance where the light condition in the external working environment is bright, the brightness setting of the monitor is adjusted to a higher setting and when the light condition of the external environment is low, the brightness setting is reduced and set at a minimum that matches the lighting condition in the work environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Way 2 : Adjusting Contrast </strong></h2>



<p>On the other hand, the contrast setting of a monitor is the ratio of white to black when images or videos are displayed on the monitor. To get the best image quality, the contrast setting should be set at a high percentage which is usually around 70% &#8211; 80%. The purpose of adjusting the monitor&#8217;s contrast setting is to increase the sharpness of texts, pictures, and videos when displayed on the monitor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Properly adjusting the brightness and contrast setting of your eyes is the first ergonomic step taken by a computer user to protect his eyes&nbsp;</p>
