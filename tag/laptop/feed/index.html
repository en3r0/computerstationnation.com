<p>The NetDot Magnetic Micro USB Charger is a universal cable that comes in multiple options. It can be bought in a one, two, or three-pack. If you’re trying to charge multiple devices and want a plug-and-play option, the three-pack is a great option.</p>



<p> It allows you a choice of style in terms of color as it comes in silver, black, or grey to match the color of your device. The cable in the charger is 3.3 feet in length, though short for some uses, but good enough for most people. </p>



<p>The charging is very stable and the strong magnet allows you to easily detach it from the connector, which can be very helpful if you need to take your phone while you are driving your car.</p>



<p>The insulation has carbon fiber, an anti-twist design; an amazing feature especially if you’re worried about your micro USB charger tangling or kinking. </p>



<p>If the cable gets twisted up, it’s easy to untangle with just a few twists of your fingers. Charging performance is good, as the cable delivers 9 volts of power at a rate of two amps. </p>



<p>Though not a quick charger, it meets manufacturer specs for charger standards. You can charge your iPhone X in about two hours, or your Samsung Galaxy S10 in about the same time.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Comes in a variety of colors.</li><li> Anti-twist design.</li><li>Good charging performance.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Short cable.</li><li>No quick charging.</li></ul>

<p>The TOPK USB Magnetic Micro USB Charger comes in a three-chord pack, making it a good fit for multiple devices. First, a 3.3-foot cable, useful for phone charging and other necessary matters. </p>



<p>Next, is a similar 3.3-foot design, but with a 90-degree tip, which aids easy charging, if cable management is an issue. Lastly, a 6.6-foot cable with a similar 90-degree tip allows for AC chargers and other long-distance applications. </p>

<p>In terms of charging performance, the TOPK USB Magnetic Micro USB Charger performs reasonably, with a maximum power delivery of 5 volts at 2.4 amps; leaving you with 12 watts of charging power. The result of which is that you can charge most modern smartphones in about 2 ½ hours. Though not superb, it is very good as it meets most people’s charging needs.</p>

<p>Just as powerful as graphics cards are becoming, and the multiplicity of functions these cards can perform. They just like every other piece of computing hardware have their lags, and this is the vibration that comes with the cards. While it can be ignored, the fact that it is audible is frustrating.</p>



<p><a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">Computer </a>graphics card vibration will not endanger the workability of your card. Nevertheless, when left unattended to it can be the foundation of issues to come and this is just why you will need to fix this problem before it gets out of hand. So let us look at the options on the list:</p>







<h2>Fixes That Are Recommended</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Dampening case</strong></h3>



<p>A dampening case is the first place to start if you seek to get a permanent fix to your graphics card vibrations.The truth is this, your graphics card might not stop vibrating as you will always get unusual current, run through it, and sometimes you will have the problem always recurring for other reasons we will soon discuss.</p>



<p>Therefore, a way to absolve the sound and get it muted can be a great delight for your smooth and undisturbed operation. You must be particular about the dampening case you are getting, there are a lot of them in the market but not all of them can do so great the job at hand.</p>



<p>So get the dampening case that comes with dampening materials, like a high fabric or foam that can conceal noise and give you the best environment to work with. While this option can be cost-effective, it pays rewards that you will surely love, and this is why we opt to have it on this list.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Check your fans</strong></h3>



<p>Sometimes the solutions we seek are there for us, but because they are negligible, we seem not to attach the needed attention to it and get it to fix just the way it is supposed to. Therefore, checking your fan can be the next great thing you can do to fix your graphics card vibrations and this is free.</p>



<p>Checking your fans will reveal the true state of the graphics card, what is responsible for your vibrations can be a dusty fan or a fan that has stopped working. So check this and try it out, it can save you from taking the next options on the list.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Replace your graphics card:</strong></h3>



<p>Sometimes, the reason for the vibrations can be a graphics card that has fail or stop working. All you have to do is to replace it with a new one, this way you get the vibrations stopped and you get a permanent fix to the situation. A win-win solution at all times.</p>



<p>Getting a new graphics card can also be advantageous to your overall development, as you get improved performance on your computer. </p>



<p>You should ensure that you are getting the right graphics card at the right time, this is not a time to experiment with things, you have to go with what works.</p>

<p>Besides, you will experience delays, when your graphics cards are connected but not properly fixed. Also, if your wires are not connected correctly, get them fixed and you are good to go. Besides, if your cords are outworn, changing them and getting a new graphics card can stop your vibrations.</p>



<h3>5. <strong>Use your headphones</strong></h3>



<p>Now, this is one real option that works just great, and it is less cost-effective. If you cannot bear the noise, then getting a headphone will be the best, you get your ears blocked from the noise and you can enjoy the best of service, working on your computer.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Electronic equipment and materials use electromagnetic coils as inductors or transformers. However, graphics cards, serve as inductors, and when current passes through the coils; it creates a magnetic field around it. </p>



<p>This field plays a huge role in how your card functions, and also the cause of vibration sometimes. Graphics cards require a strong current for it working, and when an unusual strong power passes through these coils, it causes the coil to vibrate, this happens usually when your graphics card is under immense load. </p>



<p>This particular problem is what is called graphics card vibration or coil whine. While there is no generally accepted single format to fix this problem, they are a couple of options you can try to arrive at the best result for your graphics card. We have highlighted these options on our list and trust me they are options you can try out, even on a budget.</p>



<p>Your connections can go wrong and this will surely affect how your graphics card works, a graphics card vibration is one of the regular defects you will experience on your computer with wrong connections on your graphics card.</p>



<p>The options are best rooted, and you can try any one of them. A try here will better your graphics settings and keep you working for a long time.</p>

<p>SSD is fast becoming the mainstay of the storage unit when it comes to computers and there are a couple of questions, as to why this is happening. The power-efficient nature of the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> SSD cards is one of the major reasons for the choice of SSD storage over HDD, the SSD storage uses less power.</p>



<p>Another great reason why popular opinion has cling favorably in this light, that is the choice of SSD over HDD, is how fast they load your saved information. SSD storages provide a better and improved boot time as opposed to HDD, they interestingly boot in seconds.</p>







<h2>SSD VS HDD Power consumption</h2>



<p>A comparison of the Intel X25-M G2 which saves as the interface for the SSD cards, and Wester Digital VelociRaptor HDD. This shows that SSD consumes less power than the HDD storage option.</p>



<p>This is because, on the test, the Intel X25-M G2 uses less than half of the power consumed by the Western Digital VelociRaptor. This means that for every HDD Power usage, the SSD cards consume half of such power.</p>



<p>Interestingly, even in an idle state, HDD storage still needs to spin the discs/platters even when it is not reading or writing data. Besides, this motor responsible for the spinning rests solely on the power of the system.</p>



<p>Therefore, you are guaranteed to be consuming power on an HDD storage, even when it is idle.</p>



<p>There are a couple of reasons, that contributes to the power consumption rate of the HHD cards, the way information is stored is one of them. The HHD cards have your information saved up in a mechanical format, which makes retrieval quite hectic, this, of course, will affect the retrieval time.</p>



<p>For SSD storage, your information is saved in flash memory chips, and it retains the data stored even when there is no power, this makes a whole lot of difference and affects the power consumption rate. Similarly, data retrieval on the SSD is also seamless, and this saves you the time you spend on the computer.</p>



<p>So what does energy-efficient storage does for you? It helps you save some bills off your electricity charges and this is fantastic. As the cost of things keeps increasing, learning how to save up, can be a blessing, and one of such ways; is through your electricity billings.</p>



<p>Similarly, the energy-consuming nature of the HDD cards has its effect, and one of them is the damage it does to your battery. It zaps the battery life, with the SSD storage you are guaranteed an extended battery life, which in return will boost your productivity and keep you going.</p>



<h2>Here are a few other reasons SSD storage are preferred over HDD storage:</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Increased productivity</strong></h3>

<p>With a greater boot time, the SSD cards offer increased productivity over the HDD storage, as you get just enough time on your hand to perform that task.</p>



<p>There is a thin line between finishing on time and being late, an SSD card will ensure you finish your task on time, and have enough extra time to party with friends. </p>



<p>Also, when it comes to gaming, SSD storage will run your apps faster than the HDD, and this is great for your overall gaming experience.</p>



<p>With extended battery life, staying atop your schedule is made possible.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Durability</strong></h3>



<p>Unlike HDD storage, the SSD storage has no moving parts and this is an ambience as you get your files stored up for good, you are also guaranteed absolute safety in the event, that your laptop fails or your computer gets shaken off. In both situations, you stay afloat!</p>



<p>The durable nature of the SSD cards makes them last longer and better than the HDD option, giving you a perfect return for your investment that you will always enjoy. Staying afloat the huddles of wear and tear is also made beautiful by the durable nature of the SSD cards.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>So what makes SSD cards so fast? This will come down to how your information is saved on the card, as opposed to HDD, SSD saves your information’s on flash chips. </p>



<p>So it is readily available on request, this is a major innovation that sets the SSD cards apart. This article has focused on the power consumption of SSD storage and HDD, drawing a line of distinction between them.</p>



<p>This is necessary, so you have the right information, on what is best for you as you build a computer that can last the time and serve its purpose. Energy efficiency is one of those things you will surely love.</p>



<p>In choosing a computer today, certain aspects of the computer must be scrutinized to confirm its workability and how suitable it is for the job you want to use it for. And in addition to these suitability features, the electricity consumption must be taken into note, to deflect the bills.</p>

<p>Maybe you just finally took the bull by the horns, by deciding to take the smooth transition to SSD cards that have fast become the new order. One of the things you will have issues with, is your operating system, how do you move it? On the other hand, just what should you do with it?</p>



<p>There are many ways to kills this bird, and the first part which seems safe for most people is to install the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> OS new on the SSD storage. While this may seem great, and safe, they are other ways to arrive at this destination and achieve the same result.</p>



<p>Here are a few ways to make this happen, and enjoy your new SSD cards, with all your files and programs in the right place.</p>







<h2>How to move your HDD to SSD</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Connect your USB to a SATA Drive</strong></h3>



<p>Yes, you read it correctly. Let us get started with the right connections in place to achieve our goals and set objective. Begin by connecting your SSD card, with your old HDD card and get them on a SATA Drive, all at the same time.</p>



<h3> 2. <strong>Get an AOMEI Backupper</strong></h3>



<p>Now that your HDD and SSD storage is connected, you will have to begin the process, by getting your files back up.</p>



<p>This is important for many reasons; the first is that a single click can erase your entire data, so you do not take chances with keeping your data safe on your computer, especially during this process.</p>



<p>Also, while partition, can work so fine and have your files saved in the right places. Backing them up on external memory will give you the needed extra layer of support, necessary to keep your files in the best hands. In the event of eventualities!</p>



<p>Therefore, the AOMEI Backupper will do a great job for you and help to keep your files together, just in case anything goes wrong. It is also a great program with which to clone your OS.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Back up your files</strong></h3>



<p>We have talked about the need to get your files backup, on connecting your AOMEI Backupper the next thing to do on this list, will be to back the files up and keep them in safe custody.</p>



<p>To make sure you are saving the right things only, ensure you delete redundant and unused files in your hard drive. </p>



<p>This will save up space, but importantly it will also allow you to save only the important things, and when you have them saved up, you are guaranteed the continued enjoyment of your storage. </p>



<h3>4. <strong>Plugin and initialize your SSD</strong></h3>



<p>At this stage we are assuming two things, first is the fact that your files had been backed up your hard drive, preferably as we stated, the external hard drive. Secondly, that your SATA Drive is still connected to your computer, if this is the case, we are in for the business.</p>



<p>Plugin your SSD into the SATA connected to a USB adapter and then initialize. During this, you will see the drive show up in the bottom part of the disk management screen, and you will have this captured by your AOMEI program.</p>



<h2>5. <strong>Clone your Hard Disk</strong></h2>



<p>On the left sidebar of your disk management screen, checking through AOMEI you will see two options; the first is to clone your disk, and the second to clone your system. The best and right option for this operation is to clone your disk and not your system.</p>



<p>On selecting the clone your disk option, you will be directed to choose your destination disk, choose the right disk here as it will be overwritten, you should be sure not to make a mistake on this one.</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Install your SSD</strong></h3>



<p>Now that you are done with the cloning process, you will need to install the operating system in your new storage and computer to allow it to function seamlessly, and in top gear.</p>



<p>If you followed the steps correctly, you will have all your saved data in check and intact as you get to this stage.</p>



<h3>7. <strong>Reboot</strong></h3>



<p>Just as it is with every other high-end system program installation, you will have to reboot your computer to get the best of it and have it function at its best. Interestingly, this will put your computer in shape for your functions later on.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Moving your OS from the HDD storage to the SSD can be the next best thing you will learn. With this option, you do not have to install your OS fresh; you just have to follow the process to be mentioned in this article, and boom, yes boom. Your results are guaranteed.</p>



<p>Also, if you are still on the fence, with what storage to use for your new computer. SSD is not just the way; very soon, you will not have the HDD storage again, as it is guaranteed to go extinct like other memory options before it. You are exposed to a completely new level with the SSD cards, and you cannot miss it.</p>



<p>Moving your OS from HDD to SSD is not a kill and something worth breaking the sweat for, it is a simple DIY operation that you can perform, with your eyes closed. Nevertheless, keep them open, so you do not erase your files in the backup process or overwriting phase.</p>



<p>If you followed through with all the steps outlined, we are sure you have attained your aim and you are in the best shape with your OS in the right storage device.</p>

<p>If you want a high-quality HDMI cable that’ll last you a good few years, look no further than Belkin’s HDMI 2.1 Ultra High Speed. As the name would suggest, it offers superior performance at an affordable price. That’s not the end of it, though; an excellent refresh rate and ludicrous transfer speeds of 48Gbps make this a big deal. </p>



<p>Unsure why that’s worth the cash? In short, it’s ready to serve up 10K resolution when the time comes. Better still, Belkin is a brand we’d trust with the connection between our graphics card and monitor. This is one of the best high-end HDMI cables for gaming with a transfer speed of 48 Gbps.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Great picture quality</li><li>4K at 120HZ</li><li>Up to 8K support</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Braided out jacket</li><li>It May not be compatible with all devices.</li></ul>

<p>The Z370 and Z390 motherboards are the gold standard in this 300 series motherboard, built for computer enthusiasts. These are the only Intel motherboards that support CPU and memory overclocking (if you have an unlocked K-series chip) or handle gaming rigs with multiple graphics cards, at least until Z390 boards become available. </p>



<p>They’re loaded with the most PCI-E lanes, potential USB ports (with one notable caveat—more on that after), and RAID storage options. As flagship chipsets, they also offer the most high-speed I/O lanes. More HSIO lanes let board makers divvy out more features, like NVMe SSD connections and SuperSpeed USB ports, as they see fit.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Fan control is now in the bios itself.</li><li>Has RGB lighting on the board itself.</li><li>Very simple to install.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Does not work with Windows 7.</li><li>There are only 2 main case fan headers.</li></ul>

<p>The H370 motherboards are only a notch below Z370 and Z390 and perfect for people who don’t like to tinker. These boards don’t support overclocking, multiple graphics card setups, or some of the more exotic Intel Rapid Storage Technology features. Besides those niche enthusiast features, and some differences in USB 3.1 support, H370 largely mirrors Z370.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros </strong></p>



<ul><li>Stock performance</li><li>Overclocking potential</li><li> Board aesthetics, layout, and design</li><li>UEFI BIOS design and usability</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Lack of hinged cover plate/heat sink for both M.2 slots</li><li>PCIe x2 bandwidth limitation on chipset-controlled M.2 slot</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASRock-H370-Performance-CrossFireX-Motherboards/dp/B07BMV3X79/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?tag=computersta08-20"><strong>Check it out on Amazon</strong></a></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Z390 and H370 motherboards integrate support for speedy 10Gbps USB 3.1 Gen.2 ports into the chipset. That should help bring the blisteringly fast tech to more affordable motherboards, as vendors will no longer need to pay for a third-party controller—this uses Intel’s own technology. </p>



<p>Z390 packs six ports; the others pack four. Z370 has none. Adding USB 3.1 Gen. 2 ports eats into a motherboard’s stash of HSIO lanes, though. All Intel 300-series motherboards except Z370 can support USB 3.1 Gen. 2 and integrated Wi-Fi.<br></p>



<p>The new boards also move a lot of the functions needed for wireless networking into the platform controller hub itself, using Intel’s CNVi wireless-AC technology. Highlights include integrated 802.11ac Wi-Fi support and up to 1733Mbps speeds with Intel’s highest-end companion RF module, which Intel says is far faster than most Wi-Fi options available.</p>



<p>Equipping extra hardware to activate the functionality fully can add to a motherboard&#8217;s cost, and it’s an option for motherboard vendors—not a requirement. Don’t expect to see Wi-Fi on every H370 motherboard, in other words, especially as you move further down the price scale. (Gigabyte, for example, sells an optional “CNVi WiFi upgrade kit” for some of its motherboards.) If yours includes it, you’ll want an 802.11ac “Wave 2” router that can take advantage of CNVi’s full potential, like the Asus RT-AC87U.</p>



<p>Z390 and H370 motherboards also include “modern standby” features that let computers sleep to save energy but listen for a wake word (in smart speaker-like fashion) and quickly resume. Modern standby functionality previously existed in laptops, but this is a first for desktop PCs.</p>



<p>Once again, motherboards based on the Z370 chipset don’t include any of this new native functionality, though hardware makers can add Wi-Fi and USB 3.1 Gen. 2 capabilities via add-in controllers.</p>



<p>One should only purchase a 300-series board with finishing touches that fit his/her individual needs. While the information above describes the guts of every Z390, Z370, H370, B360, and H310 motherboard, vendors can tweak and configure their hardware in different ways, so two H370 boards (for example) might have slightly different port configurations and wildly different features, such as RGB lighting, fancy audio, one-button overclocking, et cetera. </p>



<p>But now that you know the basics of what each Intel 300-series chipset offers, you can quickly narrow down your search for the perfect Intel motherboard for you. For similar products, visit <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=computersta08-20">Amazon</a></strong>.</p>
