<p>Here is the auto generated captions from YouTube, just in case:</p>



<p><em>All right we are in for a new desktop as you can see it&#8217;s a bit small four foot wide it was just the previous desktop on my previous desk before I upgraded to the to the standing desk you can see all my cords are falling down but we&#8217;ve got a solution for that today as well so you might not see a ton of the process of this but you should see some of the aftermath so there you have it much longer death issues going on back there still a lot of the courts are long enough to reach all the way over there but I mean looking pretty good obviously there&#8217;s some freshly it&#8217;s taken out to these things that kind of stink about this setup still the arms are just barely and awfully I had to Jack the seat up to the point where it&#8217;s a little bit uncomfortable this doesn&#8217;t go down any further I think I dressed telling the other video though that a business edition of the autonomous standing desk would lower but does the job I thought about trying to hack it up and cut cut little bit off the legs but that is probably going to be attempted something that&#8217;s not going to work well so you know anyways just want to give you guys a little bit of an update on the station of myself and let&#8217;s see there hopefully a monitor upgrade coming in the next two months so I&#8217;m sure I will put that on the channel as well until next time.</em></p>
