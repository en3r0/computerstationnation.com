<p>The 1920Ã—1080p widescreen resolution of this computer makes it ideal for music production, the 32-inch screen, with a 16.9 aspect ratio is a delight for anyone needing a good Monitor for music production.</p>



<p>You get crisp and clear images on this monitor, with its 165GHz refresh rate, and 178 degree wide angles, while the narrow bezel with a 1ms response time adds much to the unique nature of the monitor.</p>

<p>Also, here is the auto translate text from YouTube if you are into that:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">welcome back to the computer station<br>nation YouTube channel my name is Dustin<br>Montgomery it's been a while since we've<br>been filming stuff but that's because a<br>lot of personal changes in my life<br>anyways check out so I've been using<br>these speakers on and off since like<br>2003 there are these crazy speakers that<br>attach to the side of your monitor<br>obviously this was a big CRT back in the<br>day you just they just slot it into<br>these little holes on the side of the<br>miner and I've been using them on and<br>off ever since at one point I switched I<br>had giant stereo speakers were talking<br>something like three foot high it was<br>crazy but I moved around well since I<br>lived in my parents house when that<br>happened and I've just taken these with<br>me because they just work they just have<br>a single audio plug in yes they didn't<br>have standard colors back or they didn't<br>they messed it up back with compact<br>manufactured these speakers so it's not<br>it's not always the same color that it<br>is now anyways these things are super<br>quiet because they don't have any<br>external power but what I've been doing<br>when I when I have these set up is I<br>just set them on the stand right behind<br>the monitor so this is a triple monitor<br>mount you may have seen it with the<br>other videos check out they just sit<br>like right behind here and they get the<br>job done but they are terrible so it's<br>finally time that I retired them<br>I've had these amazon basic speakers on<br>my Amazon wishlist for like I years six<br>years but no one's ever purchased them I<br>just never follow through because these<br>are getting a job so finally somebody<br>bought them for me this past Christmas I<br>was like four months ago we moved<br>coronavirus whatever let's set these<br>things up and we're gonna start with an<br>unboxing just to see what's inside are<br>two versions of this one with AC power<br>and one<br>that is usb-powered I went with the AC<br>power just because obviously coming from<br>the one just because it didn't have a<br>lot of power I was like you know these<br>probably can go a little bit louder with<br>that not sure that's the case<br>officially but there are different<br>settings especially in your linux where<br>you can drag the volume over with the<br>max is supposed to be gets a little<br>distorted but if you need the volume so<br>i did open this previously several<br>months ago just to make sure that all<br>the parts in it there is some kind of<br>instructions nothing really exciting so<br>yeah here it is AC powered uh really not<br>a lot to say about it it's got a nice<br>volume yeah that's pretty nice very<br>simple volume control on off and even a<br>place for your headphones which I did<br>not realize existed so you can see it's<br>got a nice little headphone jack<br>I actually might use that so oh heck the<br>on and off that's nice so these are<br>still small enough that I could probably<br>set them on the stand behind the monitor<br>here let me go ahead and get these<br>things set up and I'll give you a sneak<br>peak what that looks like<br>alright so here we are taking a look at<br>the back of the triple monitor stand<br>here and as you can see we've got the<br>speakers right now they're just resting<br>there which worked well when we had the<br>old ones because they were long enough<br>that they were stable obviously this is<br>not ideal<br>I should probably tie a tie on I<br>strapped weight tie wraps<br>anyway the old plastic just hold them<br>down a little bit but yeah so you could<br>either mount them sure straight over the<br>air down at the desk whatever you find<br>works best but this way you know they're<br>nice and hidden but you can see it's a<br>pretty clean setup still you know you<br>don't have to look at the speakers if<br>you want to adjust the volume manually<br>you just reach over the monitor stand up<br>whatever you got to do but other than<br>that keeps them out of the way hidden<br>pretty well so there you have it the<br>Amazon basics computer speakers for your<br>desktop AC powered I'll put a link in<br>the description but yeah upgrading the<br>speakers on the cheap yeah I suppose one<br>important thing here is I forgot is if<br>you're wondering how these things sound<br>it's pretty very good just tension it<br>out with one of the videos I made<br>previously if you haven't checked it out<br>go ahead and check out the other videos<br>on this channel this one's the final<br>build of the computer you see right next<br>to this so yeah here's here's a test if<br>that you know helps inform your decision<br>on this purchase not the deepest base<br>but still pretty good<br>so this is gonna be great for just you<br>know casual listening there you have it<br>pretty awesome speakers go check out<br>this video maybe it'll be somewhere on<br>the screen where this finger is at head<br>over to computer station nation calm if<br>you haven't already got some great<br>guides over there on what to buy next so<br>good luck with your battle station or<br>workstation setup and we'll talk to you<br>next time</pre>
