<p>A lot of people readily store programs on an SSD storage device but with time, they realize that an SSD is built with limited storage capacity and the large number of programs saved on it will slow down its performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, they turn to the next viable option that poses as an HDD storage device but sometimes, they programs with difficulties in transferring these programs to an HDD storage location.</p>



<p>You can&nbsp; mitigate the tough discomfort thrown at your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer </a>by a solid-state drive ( SSD), by following these methods of transferring programs to a Hard disk drive ( HDD)&nbsp;</p>







<h2>Moving Programs From SSD to HDD</h2>



<h2>Copying</h2>



<p>Most operating systems do not recommend dragging, or copying programs because some programs might not run well when moved to a new storage device. However, because of the limited storage capacity of SSD’s, moving programs to HDD is just inevitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first step to successfully move files is to back them up first with a reliable backup software to prevent complete loss of programs in instances where the moving program in the new location is not supported on the operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To ensure a smooth transfer of program files and ensure that they work well, it is advisable to log in to the operating system as an administrator, before copying the files to the new storage location.</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>Activating a symbolic link command or using software to move programs from SSD to HDD is highly suitable for different kinds of programs on different operating systems. This can be easily done by changing the properties of such programs such as their bits ( Program files exist in different bits such as 32, 64, and 86 bits) and moving them to an HDD storage device. </p>



<p>One of the benefits of moving programs from SSD to HDD is that it eliminates the need to re-install these programs on their new storage location. After successfully moving the selected programs, you can choose to create a folder on the desktop for the moved programs to serve as a shortcut to easily access them.</p>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Moving complex data such as programs can be easy if you have the right support and I hope that this article was helpful for the task&nbsp;</p>

<p>Storage devices are highly important for the overall functioning and performance of a computer because it determines the volume of files that can be stored and the speed at which tasks can be executed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are different types of <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer </a>storage devices and the most popular is the Solid State Drive which is commonly called SSD and the Hard Disk Drive which is commonly called HDD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These storage devices are built with powerful control chips and other distinct features that make them perform differently. However, they are both suitable as storage devices but their performance is what makes them distinct.</p>







<h2>Why SSD Are So Popular?</h2>



<p>One of the most popular amounts of storage memory available on SSD is a 256GB SSD. However, for this discussion, we’ll be comparing it with a 1TB HDD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An HDD is a very important component of a computer that stores a large amount of data. In comparison, It has more storage features when compared to an SSD which makes it suitable for storing files, audios, videos, and images. Cost-wise, it is also more economical than an SSD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, SSD’s have more speed and this makes it a preferred choice than an HDD. It employs more transfer speed for opening and running applications which makes it more reliable than an HDD for computer performance.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Why HDD Is Considered As an Alternative To SSD</strong>?</h2>



<p>Narrowing our comparison, a 256GB has lesser storage capacity than a 1TB HDD, although a 256GB and a 1TB HDD can both store data and start an operating system, SSD’s are more preferred because of their faster performance when compared to an HDD that has more storage features. They both have similar storage capacity but a 256GB SSD performs at a very fast speed when compared to a 1TB SSD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, recent technology has created an SSHD which is a hybrid of an SSD and an HDD that is mostly found in laptops. This storage device has a larger cache and a response time that is a few times faster than an HDD, although not as fast as an HDD. In conclusion, if you are building or buying a computer, you can go with both of them if you can afford it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Samsung&#8217;s SSD 980 M.2 drive provides a powerful mid-tier option for new or returning fans of the company&#8217;s SSDs, garnering the most performance possible out of PCI Express 3.0 in 2021.</p>



<p>The Samsung SSD 980 is a four-lane PCI Express (PCIe) 3.0 drive manufactured on an M.2 Type-2280 (80mm long) design. It uses the NVMe protocol over the PCIe 3.0 bus, and it features an in-house Samsung controller. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s based on what the company calls its own sixth-generation, &#8220;up to 136-layer&#8221;, three-bit multi-level-cell (MLC) V-NAND flash, and it&#8217;s available in three storage-volume sizes: 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB. Samsung has re-ignited the debate over what an SSD should cost these days, and it enters the midrange with an MLC drive that carries a surprisingly high durability rating for its product class.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Edges out the Intel SSD 670p in 4K random reads</li><li>Competitive pricing for its performance class</li><li>Good durability rating</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>It is capped at PCI Express 3.0&#8217;s natural ceiling</li><li>Light workloads</li></ul>

<p>Intel&#8217;s SSD 660p serves up some of the best shallow-depth 4K random read performance we&#8217;ve ever seen. Specially tuned to perform ahead of the curve in tasks like booting operating systems and launching key programs, the 660p works the way we work with our SSDs. It boosts performance in daily use cases while keeping pace with the sequential-speed ceiling of PCIe 3.0. </p>



<p>As a result, the drive is often faster than some pricier PCIe 4.0 options we&#8217;ve tested, and it trades wins with drives like the Samsung SSD 980 Pro in 4K shallow random read operations. </p>



<p>Its lower durability rating and higher price-per-gigabyte for QLC could dissuade budget-focused buyers, but for anyone who values 4K speed overall, the Intel SSD 660p is the king of its own modest castle.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an M.2 Type-2280 (80mm long) design, employing the NVMe protocol over the PCI Express (PCIe) 3.0 bus, and it uses a new Silicon Motion SM2265 controller. It&#8217;s based on 144-layer triple-level-cell (TLC) NAND flash, and it&#8217;s available in three storage-volume sizes: 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Record-setting game, OS, and program load speeds for PCI Express 3.0</li><li>Higher durability ratings than most QLC NAND drives</li><li>Solid software suite</li></ul>



<p>Cons</p>



<ul><li>A bit pricey</li><li>no PCIe 4.0 support</li></ul>

<p>The Adata XPG Spectrix S40 is an unapologetically bright RGB-lit M.2 SSD that brings up your PC. Its 4K read and write speeds should keep most gamers happy too. </p>



<p>The XPG Spectrix S40G is the most flamboyant NVMe drive we&#8217;ve seen to date. But beyond the bling with its exceptional 4K write speeds, top-notch sequential-read speeds, and respectable durability rating, ADATA makes having a top-of-the line, over-the-top SSD affordable and fun, all in one good scoop.</p>



<p>The XPG Spectrix S40G is an RGB-laced, PCI Express (PCIe) 3.0, four-lane NVMe SSD. It&#8217;s based on a second-generation, 64-layer 3D triple-layer-cell (TLC) This Type-2280 (80mm-long) drive comes in four storage-volume sizes: 256GB, 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB.</p>



<p>Its durability rating is equally respectable, at 640 terabytes written (TBW) lifetime, in this capacity tier. TBW ratings, which measure expected drive life in terms of how much data you can write, tend to scale up with capacity. </p>



<p>As a result of the RGB lighting being added to the equation and the impression that this is a less &#8220;serious&#8221; drive than most one would expect to see something a bit lower but on the contrary, It&#8217;s a plus to have it remain competitive with other drives in the space.</p>



<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Exceptional 4K write and sequential read results.</li><li>Strong value proposition.</li><li>The RGB lighting is a fun addition for PC builders.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Some glitches around saving RGB settings with multiple profiles.</li><li>Random Read</li></ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Definitely, you can find many ways to improve the performance of a lower laptop, but you may find that replacing HDD with an SSD is the easiest and fastest of all methods. Making the change will, in most cases, dramatically reduce the time to boot Windows, load programs, edit videos, play games, transfer large amounts of files, etc. Here are some obvious advantages that can explain why SSD is the best choice for laptop hard drive replacement.</p>



<p>The process of upgrading your laptop to SSD is quite simple if you have easy access to your hard drive via a removable panel on the bottom of the laptop. If you have an Ultrabook or your laptop doesn&#8217;t have that kind of easy upgrade access (e.g., the bottom panel is sealed), it&#8217;s a whole different ballgame, and you&#8217;ll need to consult your laptop manual for instructions on how to get to that drive and finding the right replacement drive.</p>



<p>Faster speed: SSD disks offer much faster speeds than traditional HDDs. When you upgrade hard drive in laptop to SSD, you will experience faster boot times and response times when loading your files or folders.</p>



<p>Rugged data protection: SSD disks are much better at protecting your data from accidental damage caused by knocking or dropping the drive. This is because SSDs do not contain any movable parts like traditional HDDs which contain many. On top of this, SSDs are lighter, quieter, more durable, produce less heat, and consume less power.</p>



<p>We would recommend the Samsung SSD 980 for durability, efficiency, and value for your money given the price, it takes enough victories back from the Intel SSD 670p among mainstream PCI Express 3.0 M.2 SSDs it tops with enough value for its performance, it&#8217;s pricing, and some solid software options. Visit <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=computersta08-20">Amazon.com</a> </strong>to explore other options.</p>

<p>SSD is fast becoming the mainstay of the storage unit when it comes to computers and there are a couple of questions, as to why this is happening. The power-efficient nature of the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> SSD cards is one of the major reasons for the choice of SSD storage over HDD, the SSD storage uses less power.</p>



<p>Another great reason why popular opinion has cling favorably in this light, that is the choice of SSD over HDD, is how fast they load your saved information. SSD storages provide a better and improved boot time as opposed to HDD, they interestingly boot in seconds.</p>







<h2>SSD VS HDD Power consumption</h2>



<p>A comparison of the Intel X25-M G2 which saves as the interface for the SSD cards, and Wester Digital VelociRaptor HDD. This shows that SSD consumes less power than the HDD storage option.</p>



<p>This is because, on the test, the Intel X25-M G2 uses less than half of the power consumed by the Western Digital VelociRaptor. This means that for every HDD Power usage, the SSD cards consume half of such power.</p>



<p>Interestingly, even in an idle state, HDD storage still needs to spin the discs/platters even when it is not reading or writing data. Besides, this motor responsible for the spinning rests solely on the power of the system.</p>



<p>Therefore, you are guaranteed to be consuming power on an HDD storage, even when it is idle.</p>



<p>There are a couple of reasons, that contributes to the power consumption rate of the HHD cards, the way information is stored is one of them. The HHD cards have your information saved up in a mechanical format, which makes retrieval quite hectic, this, of course, will affect the retrieval time.</p>



<p>For SSD storage, your information is saved in flash memory chips, and it retains the data stored even when there is no power, this makes a whole lot of difference and affects the power consumption rate. Similarly, data retrieval on the SSD is also seamless, and this saves you the time you spend on the computer.</p>



<p>So what does energy-efficient storage does for you? It helps you save some bills off your electricity charges and this is fantastic. As the cost of things keeps increasing, learning how to save up, can be a blessing, and one of such ways; is through your electricity billings.</p>



<p>Similarly, the energy-consuming nature of the HDD cards has its effect, and one of them is the damage it does to your battery. It zaps the battery life, with the SSD storage you are guaranteed an extended battery life, which in return will boost your productivity and keep you going.</p>



<h2>Here are a few other reasons SSD storage are preferred over HDD storage:</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Increased productivity</strong></h3>



<p>They are a couple of things a processor that is not fast and not always handy will do to your computing operations; one of such is your productivity. </p>



<p>With a greater boot time, the SSD cards offer increased productivity over the HDD storage, as you get just enough time on your hand to perform that task.</p>



<p>There is a thin line between finishing on time and being late, an SSD card will ensure you finish your task on time, and have enough extra time to party with friends. </p>



<p>Also, when it comes to gaming, SSD storage will run your apps faster than the HDD, and this is great for your overall gaming experience.</p>



<p>With extended battery life, staying atop your schedule is made possible.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Durability</strong></h3>



<p>Unlike HDD storage, the SSD storage has no moving parts and this is an ambience as you get your files stored up for good, you are also guaranteed absolute safety in the event, that your laptop fails or your computer gets shaken off. In both situations, you stay afloat!</p>



<p>The durable nature of the SSD cards makes them last longer and better than the HDD option, giving you a perfect return for your investment that you will always enjoy. Staying afloat the huddles of wear and tear is also made beautiful by the durable nature of the SSD cards.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>So what makes SSD cards so fast? This will come down to how your information is saved on the card, as opposed to HDD, SSD saves your information’s on flash chips. </p>



<p>So it is readily available on request, this is a major innovation that sets the SSD cards apart. This article has focused on the power consumption of SSD storage and HDD, drawing a line of distinction between them.</p>



<p>This is necessary, so you have the right information, on what is best for you as you build a computer that can last the time and serve its purpose. Energy efficiency is one of those things you will surely love.</p>



<p>In choosing a computer today, certain aspects of the computer must be scrutinized to confirm its workability and how suitable it is for the job you want to use it for. And in addition to these suitability features, the electricity consumption must be taken into note, to deflect the bills.</p>

<p>Maybe you just finally took the bull by the horns, by deciding to take the smooth transition to SSD cards that have fast become the new order. One of the things you will have issues with, is your operating system, how do you move it? On the other hand, just what should you do with it?</p>



<p>There are many ways to kills this bird, and the first part which seems safe for most people is to install the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> OS new on the SSD storage. While this may seem great, and safe, they are other ways to arrive at this destination and achieve the same result.</p>



<p>Here are a few ways to make this happen, and enjoy your new SSD cards, with all your files and programs in the right place.</p>







<h2>How to move your HDD to SSD</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Connect your USB to a SATA Drive</strong></h3>



<p>Yes, you read it correctly. Let us get started with the right connections in place to achieve our goals and set objective. Begin by connecting your SSD card, with your old HDD card and get them on a SATA Drive, all at the same time.</p>



<h3> 2. <strong>Get an AOMEI Backupper</strong></h3>



<p>Now that your HDD and SSD storage is connected, you will have to begin the process, by getting your files back up.</p>



<p>This is important for many reasons; the first is that a single click can erase your entire data, so you do not take chances with keeping your data safe on your computer, especially during this process.</p>



<p>Also, while partition, can work so fine and have your files saved in the right places. Backing them up on external memory will give you the needed extra layer of support, necessary to keep your files in the best hands. In the event of eventualities!</p>



<p>Therefore, the AOMEI Backupper will do a great job for you and help to keep your files together, just in case anything goes wrong. It is also a great program with which to clone your OS.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Back up your files</strong></h3>



<p>We have talked about the need to get your files backup, on connecting your AOMEI Backupper the next thing to do on this list, will be to back the files up and keep them in safe custody.</p>



<p>To make sure you are saving the right things only, ensure you delete redundant and unused files in your hard drive. </p>



<p>This will save up space, but importantly it will also allow you to save only the important things, and when you have them saved up, you are guaranteed the continued enjoyment of your storage. </p>



<h3>4. <strong>Plugin and initialize your SSD</strong></h3>



<p>At this stage we are assuming two things, first is the fact that your files had been backed up your hard drive, preferably as we stated, the external hard drive. Secondly, that your SATA Drive is still connected to your computer, if this is the case, we are in for the business.</p>



<p>Plugin your SSD into the SATA connected to a USB adapter and then initialize. During this, you will see the drive show up in the bottom part of the disk management screen, and you will have this captured by your AOMEI program.</p>



<h2>5. <strong>Clone your Hard Disk</strong></h2>



<p>On the left sidebar of your disk management screen, checking through AOMEI you will see two options; the first is to clone your disk, and the second to clone your system. The best and right option for this operation is to clone your disk and not your system.</p>



<p>On selecting the clone your disk option, you will be directed to choose your destination disk, choose the right disk here as it will be overwritten, you should be sure not to make a mistake on this one.</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Install your SSD</strong></h3>



<p>Now that you are done with the cloning process, you will need to install the operating system in your new storage and computer to allow it to function seamlessly, and in top gear.</p>



<p>If you followed the steps correctly, you will have all your saved data in check and intact as you get to this stage.</p>



<h3>7. <strong>Reboot</strong></h3>



<p>Just as it is with every other high-end system program installation, you will have to reboot your computer to get the best of it and have it function at its best. Interestingly, this will put your computer in shape for your functions later on.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Moving your OS from the HDD storage to the SSD can be the next best thing you will learn. With this option, you do not have to install your OS fresh; you just have to follow the process to be mentioned in this article, and boom, yes boom. Your results are guaranteed.</p>



<p>Also, if you are still on the fence, with what storage to use for your new computer. SSD is not just the way; very soon, you will not have the HDD storage again, as it is guaranteed to go extinct like other memory options before it. You are exposed to a completely new level with the SSD cards, and you cannot miss it.</p>



<p>Moving your OS from HDD to SSD is not a kill and something worth breaking the sweat for, it is a simple DIY operation that you can perform, with your eyes closed. Nevertheless, keep them open, so you do not erase your files in the backup process or overwriting phase.</p>



<p>If you followed through with all the steps outlined, we are sure you have attained your aim and you are in the best shape with your OS in the right storage device.</p>
