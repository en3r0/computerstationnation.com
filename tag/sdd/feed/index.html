<p>SSD is fast becoming the mainstay of the storage unit when it comes to computers and there are a couple of questions, as to why this is happening. The power-efficient nature of the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> SSD cards is one of the major reasons for the choice of SSD storage over HDD, the SSD storage uses less power.</p>



<p>Another great reason why popular opinion has cling favorably in this light, that is the choice of SSD over HDD, is how fast they load your saved information. SSD storages provide a better and improved boot time as opposed to HDD, they interestingly boot in seconds.</p>







<h2>SSD VS HDD Power consumption</h2>



<p>A comparison of the Intel X25-M G2 which saves as the interface for the SSD cards, and Wester Digital VelociRaptor HDD. This shows that SSD consumes less power than the HDD storage option.</p>



<p>This is because, on the test, the Intel X25-M G2 uses less than half of the power consumed by the Western Digital VelociRaptor. This means that for every HDD Power usage, the SSD cards consume half of such power.</p>



<p>Interestingly, even in an idle state, HDD storage still needs to spin the discs/platters even when it is not reading or writing data. Besides, this motor responsible for the spinning rests solely on the power of the system.</p>



<p>Therefore, you are guaranteed to be consuming power on an HDD storage, even when it is idle.</p>



<p>There are a couple of reasons, that contributes to the power consumption rate of the HHD cards, the way information is stored is one of them. The HHD cards have your information saved up in a mechanical format, which makes retrieval quite hectic, this, of course, will affect the retrieval time.</p>



<p>For SSD storage, your information is saved in flash memory chips, and it retains the data stored even when there is no power, this makes a whole lot of difference and affects the power consumption rate. Similarly, data retrieval on the SSD is also seamless, and this saves you the time you spend on the computer.</p>



<p>So what does energy-efficient storage does for you? It helps you save some bills off your electricity charges and this is fantastic. As the cost of things keeps increasing, learning how to save up, can be a blessing, and one of such ways; is through your electricity billings.</p>



<p>Similarly, the energy-consuming nature of the HDD cards has its effect, and one of them is the damage it does to your battery. It zaps the battery life, with the SSD storage you are guaranteed an extended battery life, which in return will boost your productivity and keep you going.</p>



<h2>Here are a few other reasons SSD storage are preferred over HDD storage:</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Increased productivity</strong></h3>



<p>They are a couple of things a processor that is not fast and not always handy will do to your computing operations; one of such is your productivity. </p>



<p>With a greater boot time, the SSD cards offer increased productivity over the HDD storage, as you get just enough time on your hand to perform that task.</p>



<p>There is a thin line between finishing on time and being late, an SSD card will ensure you finish your task on time, and have enough extra time to party with friends. </p>



<p>Also, when it comes to gaming, SSD storage will run your apps faster than the HDD, and this is great for your overall gaming experience.</p>



<p>With extended battery life, staying atop your schedule is made possible.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Durability</strong></h3>



<p>Unlike HDD storage, the SSD storage has no moving parts and this is an ambience as you get your files stored up for good, you are also guaranteed absolute safety in the event, that your laptop fails or your computer gets shaken off. In both situations, you stay afloat!</p>



<p>The durable nature of the SSD cards makes them last longer and better than the HDD option, giving you a perfect return for your investment that you will always enjoy. Staying afloat the huddles of wear and tear is also made beautiful by the durable nature of the SSD cards.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>So what makes SSD cards so fast? This will come down to how your information is saved on the card, as opposed to HDD, SSD saves your informationâ€™s on flash chips. </p>



<p>So it is readily available on request, this is a major innovation that sets the SSD cards apart. This article has focused on the power consumption of SSD storage and HDD, drawing a line of distinction between them.</p>



<p>This is necessary, so you have the right information, on what is best for you as you build a computer that can last the time and serve its purpose. Energy efficiency is one of those things you will surely love.</p>



<p>In choosing a computer today, certain aspects of the computer must be scrutinized to confirm its workability and how suitable it is for the job you want to use it for. And in addition to these suitability features, the electricity consumption must be taken into note, to deflect the bills.</p>



<p>The SSD storage is power efficient and great when it comes to this question of what works best and how in the energy-efficient table. Settling for the SSD cards, irrespective of the price range can be a blessing in disguise, and this is for many good reasons, mentioned above.</p>

<p>Maybe you just finally took the bull by the horns, by deciding to take the smooth transition to SSD cards that have fast become the new order. One of the things you will have issues with, is your operating system, how do you move it? On the other hand, just what should you do with it?</p>



<p>There are many ways to kills this bird, and the first part which seems safe for most people is to install the <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> OS new on the SSD storage. While this may seem great, and safe, they are other ways to arrive at this destination and achieve the same result.</p>



<p>Here are a few ways to make this happen, and enjoy your new SSD cards, with all your files and programs in the right place.</p>







<h2>How to move your HDD to SSD</h2>



<h3>1.<strong>Connect your USB to a SATA Drive</strong></h3>



<p>Yes, you read it correctly. Let us get started with the right connections in place to achieve our goals and set objective. Begin by connecting your SSD card, with your old HDD card and get them on a SATA Drive, all at the same time.</p>



<h3> 2. <strong>Get an AOMEI Backupper</strong></h3>



<p>Now that your HDD and SSD storage is connected, you will have to begin the process, by getting your files back up.</p>



<p>This is important for many reasons; the first is that a single click can erase your entire data, so you do not take chances with keeping your data safe on your computer, especially during this process.</p>



<p>Also, while partition, can work so fine and have your files saved in the right places. Backing them up on external memory will give you the needed extra layer of support, necessary to keep your files in the best hands. In the event of eventualities!</p>



<p>Therefore, the AOMEI Backupper will do a great job for you and help to keep your files together, just in case anything goes wrong. It is also a great program with which to clone your OS.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Back up your files</strong></h3>



<p>We have talked about the need to get your files backup, on connecting your AOMEI Backupper the next thing to do on this list, will be to back the files up and keep them in safe custody.</p>



<p>To make sure you are saving the right things only, ensure you delete redundant and unused files in your hard drive. </p>



<p>This will save up space, but importantly it will also allow you to save only the important things, and when you have them saved up, you are guaranteed the continued enjoyment of your storage. </p>



<h3>4. <strong>Plugin and initialize your SSD</strong></h3>



<p>At this stage we are assuming two things, first is the fact that your files had been backed up your hard drive, preferably as we stated, the external hard drive. Secondly, that your SATA Drive is still connected to your computer, if this is the case, we are in for the business.</p>



<p>Plugin your SSD into the SATA connected to a USB adapter and then initialize. During this, you will see the drive show up in the bottom part of the disk management screen, and you will have this captured by your AOMEI program.</p>



<h2>5. <strong>Clone your Hard Disk</strong></h2>



<p>On the left sidebar of your disk management screen, checking through AOMEI you will see two options; the first is to clone your disk, and the second to clone your system. The best and right option for this operation is to clone your disk and not your system.</p>



<p>On selecting the clone your disk option, you will be directed to choose your destination disk, choose the right disk here as it will be overwritten, you should be sure not to make a mistake on this one.</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Install your SSD</strong></h3>



<p>Now that you are done with the cloning process, you will need to install the operating system in your new storage and computer to allow it to function seamlessly, and in top gear.</p>



<p>If you followed the steps correctly, you will have all your saved data in check and intact as you get to this stage.</p>



<h3>7. <strong>Reboot</strong></h3>



<p>Just as it is with every other high-end system program installation, you will have to reboot your computer to get the best of it and have it function at its best. Interestingly, this will put your computer in shape for your functions later on.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Moving your OS from the HDD storage to the SSD can be the next best thing you will learn. With this option, you do not have to install your OS fresh; you just have to follow the process to be mentioned in this article, and boom, yes boom. Your results are guaranteed.</p>



<p>Also, if you are still on the fence, with what storage to use for your new computer. SSD is not just the way; very soon, you will not have the HDD storage again, as it is guaranteed to go extinct like other memory options before it. You are exposed to a completely new level with the SSD cards, and you cannot miss it.</p>



<p>Moving your OS from HDD to SSD is not a kill and something worth breaking the sweat for, it is a simple DIY operation that you can perform, with your eyes closed. Nevertheless, keep them open, so you do not erase your files in the backup process or overwriting phase.</p>



<p>If you followed through with all the steps outlined, we are sure you have attained your aim and you are in the best shape with your OS in the right storage device.</p>
