<p>SSD’s are well known for their speed and enhanced performance of the operating system and the applications installed on the computer but it is not all rosy especially with its storage capacity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite their outstanding speed, they are not an ideal storage location for files because of their poor storage capacity which gets full in no time and thus leading to the very same thing that you’ve been avoiding all along – slow performance.</p>



<p>To sustain the speed of your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer&#8217;s</a> SSD, you need to pair it with an HDD. HDDs are excellent storage devices that support heavy-duty files in large volumes. They are easily affordable and function excellently with an SSD in a computer as an alternative storage device for your files.</p>







<h2>Moving Files From SSD to HDD</h2>



<p>There are different ways that you employ to move files from SSD to HDD and they include</p>



<h2>Dragging</h2>



<p>Selecting and dragging them from their previous location on the SSD and dropping them on a new location saved on the HDD</p>



<h2>Copy and Paste</h2>



<p>Copying the files from the previous location on SSD and pasting them in a new location on the HDD can be done by right clicking on the desired file that wants to be moved, activating the copy option, creating a folder on the new location, and pasting it there. The files saved on the previous SSD location have to be deleted to avoid having duplicate files so that the computer can recognize a single file.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>When transferring a large number of files at the same time, it is advisable to use a software application that supports the moving of files to a new hard drive. This software allows the quick moving of large files to different locations in the computer. This feature is sustained by its strong compatibility with windows and different storage devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, create a folder on your chosen software. Choose a new storage location for saving the files ( HDD) and save the files. The files and subsequent ones will be automatically saved on the new storage location which is the HDD.</p>



<h2>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The copy and paste, and then drag and drop features are only suitable for moving a small number of files. In other words, when moving a large amount of files, they should be moved in bits moved through a software after the HDD has been set to an NTFS format.</p>
