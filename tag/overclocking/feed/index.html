<p>Upgrades are essentials and should be part of every computer package that is thrown our way. To achieve the best performance on your <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/best-computers/">computer</a> you will need to optimize the computer to reach its highest limits.</p>



<p>We are not advising that you push your computer to the brinks, you can, however, upgrade to some extent.Besides, for computers, just like every other aspect of electronics, upgrades will see them running at their best and with improved performance. If your video rendering and 3D animation run slowly, the sign on the wall is that your computer needs some upgrading.</p>



<p>While upgrading is great, it is cost-effective and this is where Overclocking is your best bite. Overclocking is a way of stretching your computer&#8217;s powers, to reach its highest height. Moreover, this is in no way, the same as upgrading the computer, even though they perform an identical function.</p>







<h2><strong>What is Overclocking</strong>?</h2>



<p>This may have to ring a bell, and probably this is not the first time you are hearing it. We will love to define it by way of describing it than giving it a clear-cut meaning. </p>



<p>Computers come with what is called a clock speed, and the manufacturer usually sets this, it is the same as your car that comes with some Horsepower.</p>



<p>Just the same way you can tone your car engine to reach new heights, you can increase the clock speed of the computer to meet new standards. This clock speed is usually the core clock, but also understand that not all computers can be overclocked.</p>



<p>The higher you overclock the computer, the more performance you get. Also, if you are into graphics rendering and modeling you are sure of having improved performance in this regard as well.</p>



<p>With your games run smoothly and leaving you on the tail end of a brand new experience, so here are a few ways to achieve this result.</p>



<h3>1.<strong>Get an Overclocking tool</strong></h3>



<p>MSI Afterburner is a proven tool in this area and it serves the purpose with more than enough clarity, but they are more and better Overclocking tools you can use for this same function and achieve the same result.</p>



<p>Also, if you are one of those unique people that love trying and spicing things up, you can experiment with various other tools cut out for this purpose. The most important thing is the result it produces.</p>



<p>So here is the thing, it is like going to war. You will need your ammunition and other things, which will set you apart and make you, win at war. The Overclocking tool is the first way to start this war and win at it.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Conduct a benchmark stress test</strong></h3>



<p>You have your Overclocking tool in place, the next thing of interest is the benchmarking tool. This can be the same tool like the one you will be use for benchmarking or a different one altogether. Irrespective of the case, a benchmarking tool is important for several reasons.</p>



<p>It gives you a perfect balance of your current computer settings and this will help you to get a perfect point to balance things up, just in case your Overclocking gets off the mark.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Benchmark your current computer settings</strong></h3>



<p>You have the benchmarking tool, preferably MSI Afterburner or any other tool of choice you are using, the next thing is to benchmark your computer.</p>



<p>If you are using the MSI Afterburner, all you have to do is to launch the software and on the main dashboard, you will see your current computer’s clock speed, memory, and temperature.</p>



<p>Ensure you do not embark on the operation if your computer temperature is above 90°, this is not ideal and will not offer you the right solutions. If you are using either of 3DMark or Furmark, the process is self-same as that of MSI AFTERBURNER.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Overclock the GPU</strong></h3>



<p>The computer had been benchmarked and by now everything is in place, your Overclocking tool is perfectly running and the temperature is great. The next thing is to overclock the GPU; some will want to do this at a go, maximum Overclocking.</p>



<p>The best thing here is to start slowing and test run, you can overclock by 5% and check to see if it affects the system performance or not, and if everything is perfect, you can increase it to 10%, the goal however is to ensure you have all your T’s crossed and your I’s dotted.</p>



<h3>5. <strong>Overclock the memory</strong></h3>



<p>The computer&#8217;s memory is as important as the GPU, and with the GPU overclocked, you can still end up with the same issues on your computer, that is the slow gameplay and others that have prompted the Overclocking.</p>



<p>To have a balance, overclock the memory too. This will put everything in shape and help you perform at your best, but just like the Graphics card, ensure you take it easy. Go at 10% for the first start and increase same, with time.</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Fine Tune</strong></h3>



<p>You have done the job right. The next thing in line is to fine-tune and see just how perfect it clicks and if you did a beautiful job with everything, you have thrown into it. Begin by running a few games and see for yourself the level of improvements done with the Overclocking.</p>



<p>If you are desirous of adding a few more speeds, then go for it and come back to fine-tune. If on the other hand, you experience lags, ensure to recheck the Overclocking and reduce the clocking by some percentage.</p>



<p>Play the games at higher resolutions, after all, this is everything you wanted to do and this is what has prompted the Overclocking in the first place. Try this and see if it is perfect.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Overclocking is a great way to arrive at the best results with your computer, while doing this all-important task, ensure you don’t overheat your computer. The goal is to improve the functionality of the computer, and not to break it down.</p>



<p>Do not also auto-overclock the computer, this will be counterproductive.</p>
