<p>What comes to your mind when the idea of a man cave crosses your mind? I call mine “a fortress of solitude”. It is that special room somewhere around the house that is fully dedicated to me, where I get to be myself and play by my own rules without being questioned.</p>



<p>A man cave is more than just a room. It is a personal sanctuary where you can be whatever you want to be without being bothered by anyone. It’s that place where you and your buddies can relax, grab some drinks and most importantly play some games.</p>



<p>Creating a gaming man cave that is both cool, tasteful and mature can be a bit tough especially when you have no idea what you want it to look like. While this post will take care of the cave itself, <a href="https://computerstationnation.com/desks/gaming-desks/">if you are looking for gaming desks</a>, check out that page.</p>



<p>That is why I decided to put together 30 gaming man cave ideas just for you. Trust me, you’ll be oozing with beautiful pictures of how your gaming man cave should look like no matter the size or location of your room, moreover, what’s the purpose of having a man cave if you can’t show it off to your friends?</p>

<p>This wonderful hue lightning gaming man cave has an appeal that is both inviting and comfortable. Gaming is one activity that requires comfortability as a prerequisite and that is what this room offers starting from the couch to the entire set up. Its simplicity is accompanied by a bias modular lighting TV and a speaker that adds to the charm in this room. It has an incredible speaker that uplifts your sound system. I can’t imagine what playing a game without a super cool sound system would be like &#8211; boring and easily tiring. The importance of a sound system can not be overstressed. It contributes immensely to the liveliness of the room. This setting has a homely look that is charming in a soft way.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>I still can’t find the word that will do justice to this room. (You might wanna help out) because I think breathtaking is an understatement. If you’re finding it difficult to create that jaw-dropping lighting with just bulbs and fixtures, then you might want to consider trying LED lights to give your room this heavenly setting which has a cool look that easily creates the perfect atmosphere for games. It has a comfortable manly appeal that will sell you off as someone that is neat and tidy because that is what this room is all about. You could use a universal controller mounts to hang the controller perfectly under the TV to give it that perfect gaming appeal.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>To the lovers of golf, it can also be an indoor sport. This perfect layout brings golfing to your very own abode. It gives the sport a serene and homely appeal that makes it ideal for any weather conditions. This means you can play golf in the comfort of your home without worrying about the weather. It is super easy to create by simply using well mowed artificial grass or a carpet that looks just like this. This room comes with a couch that is as cozy as it looks where you can comfortably strategize your moves and carry out other activities such as reading, thinking or discussing business.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>You’ll agree with me that a game is super fun when played in the company of two to three friends. Gaming is an idea that brings people together. The beautiful thing about this layout is that you don’t have to wait for your turn. With an incredible and comfortable racing game chair fitted to a screen just at your sitting level, you can feel the heavens at that spot. Well, if you’re wondering what the big screen would be for, it can facilitate the addition of a fifth player. The room is fairly&nbsp;spacious which means you can still add more games and other accessories that suit your taste.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The set up of this cozy gaming room is both warm and pocket friendly. Unlike what you’ve been thinking, setting up a gaming room doesn’t have to cost a fortune and it doesn’t have to take up much space. With an easy to make a shelf that is charming in its simplicity, you can easily keep track of your favorite stack of games and other collections that you fancy. The beautiful thing about this gaming man cave setting is that your collections and game controllers are within your reach.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>This battle station gaming cave is definitely something to fall in love with. It has a heroic appeal that shows off your collections in class and style provided by the custom cabinet. It offers a heavenly sight to your collections especially with the recliner that is at the same level with your monitor to provide comfort without having to strain your neck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This matte white angular desk is custom built which means you can do it yourself or have a carpenter do it for you. The shelves built into the underside of the desk makes it a nice hiding place for wires, USB slots and whatever you don’t want to be clustering around on your desk.</p>

<p>A major reason why I love LED lightings is the sophistication it adorns your room with. These lights can be adjusted for brightness, RGB and other amazing effects&nbsp;that give your room the charm that a gaming man cave is supposed to have. An amazing thing about this setup is that it allows you the flexibility to multi-task, thanks to the three separate monitors and a reclining chair, you could be everywhere at the same time without stressing it. It also has a big TV screen that provides a larger display and can also serve a purpose that is entirely different from what the other monitor does.</p>

<p>This setup is perfect for your basement. The floors are made of waterproof vinyl planks to prevent you from losing all your highly prized and personal stuff that adorns your man cave. It is the perfect solution especially if you live in areas that are highly prone to flooding. One important item that you wouldn’t want to lose is your furniture especially if it is a leather couch. Having a leather chair is widely attested to be great for gaming. It is super comfy for playing games while having a nice cold drink. This room is also perfect if you do not fancy having a bar in your man cave- a refrigerator does the job well.</p>

<p>A lot of guys have an impressive collection ranging from games such as n64, super famicom, Saturn, sega cdx , dream cast, turbo duo, PS2, NES, master systems and game cube that needs to be well displayed in a way that makes it appealing to the other party as it is to them. This setting provides you with a great picture that is organized and tidy and still keeps its manliness at a top-notch. The tidy high shelves bring to mind an idea of how you could perfectly display your trophies like the prized possessions that they are while giving the TV and its strong TV stand a great display.</p>

<p>The 65 inches tv is the most outstanding feature of this man cave. A bigger screen makes the images appear very clear and more realistic which creates the perfect atmosphere for any kind of game. The matching walls and sofas add to the calmness of this cave. It is a perfect fortress for relaxation, many thanks to the LED smart home lights that are adjustable to any preferred color and Monster LED light strips that are quite affordable. It is scarcely furnished but the few furniture adorns the room in a cozy way.</p>

<p>Another wonderful place you could set up your man cave Is in the attic. It provides you with natural light and a feeling that is kingly especially as you get to oversee other activities around your neighborhood without being noticed. The window could also serve as a perfect getaway for a little distraction when you are tired of playing games. You should also include a gaming recliner in your room for more comfort and ease.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The manly and classy elegance of this man cave speaks for itself. It is dominating in a silent yet appealing way. If you’re the kind that prefers a bigger screen over everything else, then this room is made just for you. It has a rack that is large enough to hold your receiver and your wires so you don’t make a mess out of everything. The tasteful desk has a calm color that matches the walls. The heavenly black leather chairs also provide a comfortable feeling to the secured feeling that this cave holds.</p>

<p>This has a central theme in mind. If you&#8217;re a die-hard fan of rocket leagues, then your fantasy just played out. It is built in a particular fashion that displays a deep love for a particular game. It can be recreated in a way that speaks volumes about&nbsp;your love for a game without appearing childish at all. This hearty room is designed in a way that allows for a fair quantity of light, placing your couch just between the tv and the game table which affords you the comfort of doing either in a way that is pleasant to you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This setting can warm the heart of virtually anybody, especially your female buddies and kids. It is clearly the end result of dedication and a blazing passion for a game that needs a soft touch hence its color. The concept behind most gaming caves is our inability to let go of our adolescence and having our cherished desire and youthfulness staring right at us in a place where no one forces you to be anything other than yourself. This cave speaks to both a full-grown man and a teenager with it’s well organized and tasteful display of figurines and any other collectible you may have.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of multi-colored lights, then you might want to consider this. This light gives it a look that is hungry for adventure and that desired adventure will play out well if you&#8217;re gaming in a room like this. The play station light displayed under the monitor contributes to the heavenly feeling of playing a game. I&#8217;ll recommend this setup if, like me, you don&#8217;t mind being surrounded by screens that are not so far apart from each other.</p>

<p>This does look like a painting but it is so real. It is a wonderful place for men because of its relaxing theme that is both refreshing and strength filled. So, if you’re considering throwing away some of your old items and furniture, frames,&nbsp;poles, mirrors and other things, you should consider putting them into creative use by creating a man cave with a wall that looks like this. The well-polished look gives it an Irish theme that is sophisticated and charming coupled with its cool pallet board wall. It conveniently houses a great pub which has space for beers, wines and some food or snacks which means you barely have to go out once you’re in here.</p>

<p>LED lights are an amazing way to decorate a man cave. The RGB 5050 light strips coupled with the purple string lights, LED channels and diffusers gives the room a heroic feel that places everything right without any being more catching than the other. With a nice shelf to stock your collection of games and movies. You can barely run out of space in a room like this one. An example is the dual monitor mount that holds a 35 and 27 inches monitor which makes the difference in size barely noticeable because of the monitor adapter used for leveling the heights of the monitors. The well placed 8 inches gladiator workbench has enough room for items which contribute to the organized feel of the cave.</p>

<p>Having a lot of incredible game collections and sizable carpentry to stack them can be tiring when trying to figure out how you want your cave to be like. You might want to consider giving your man cave this look. The number of shelves in the room does add to the charm in it; making the room tidy, neat and manly and very organized. The recliner leather chairs are also very comfortable and can be easily substituted for a different purpose when the need arises.</p>

<p>A spacious basement should have this look. This cave is a tasteful and well-planned setup that has both a video gaming space and a classy pool table, each fairly apart from each other. The pool table has enough rooms for the sticks and fluance standing speakers in front, center, pole sides and rear that helps in setting a mood for any game of your choice. The looks are similar to a serene environment that can also be a getaway from distractions and help you think better.</p>

<p>Who doesn’t love RGB?. Even girls love RGB. A vapor colored Scheme fits into any weather condition. Cool for hot weather and warm for the winter season. This room can even defeat the purpose of a living room because you just wouldn’t want to go out. The 16ft. “super night” RGBW with a magic home controller that can be easily controlled from your phone or PC. The inviting look of the couch is credited to the LEDs under the couch that is powered by a rubber car sleeve that matches the carpet which immensely contributes to the intoxicating look of this cave.</p>

<p>Lighting is an important part of a gaming room and this sight testifies to that fact. It will do your eyes a lot of good if they have something to distract them when being focused on the screen and this is what this clean princely look does. With a setting like this, you don’t have to worry about getting your eyes strained while playing games( the lights behind tv takes care of this ) It also has an adjoining bar where you could act as a pretend bartender while having some drink with your friends without having to worry about missing a single picture on the big tv screen.</p>

<p>If the lady of the house has given you permission to set up your own man cave in the basement after serious considerations, then this look will do justice to pacify her because this setting has a family theme attached to it. If you’re considering throwing away that table because you think it’s old school, you might want to reconsider by turning it into a pool table. This setting is fairly spacious in its different compartment which means you and your friends can play different games and grab some beers while at it without having to worry about discomfort.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Giving your gaming cave a look like this is like bringing sunset to your own very abode. This heavenly look could be yours by simply using a hue light strip lighting on the bulbs, behind the TV and even the couch (all with a nightglow tagged preset). The lighting has a flexible effect that allows you to change the colors to whatever you want such as setting a timer that changes it to white during the day and slowly turning into this look during evenings is a nice idea to help cool off after a stressful day at work. Most hue lights come with adhesive strips so you could fit it into whatever corner that you want.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>A gaming cave doesn’t have to be built with a particular game in mind. This room is quite spacious which means that more gaming equipment can be added to further improve its look. It has a nice and easy to carry table where you can play table games without getting in the way of your buddy that&#8217;s playing with the pinball machine or watching video games. The bar stand is situated away from the entire gaming layout which gives it a whole vibe that is different from what the gaming&nbsp;room professes. The beautiful yet soft Led light behind the tv and at the bar stand provides a nice contrast that adds to the unique beauty of the room.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The importance of a big tv screen for gaming cannot be overemphasized. It has a thrilling and overwhelming effect on its players, offering them a nice and bigger picture of the game. This cave has a nice setup starting from the couch to the desk and the LED lights that gives the room a central look. It is perfect for a man that doesn’t want much light in his cave, preferring to make it look sacred, off-limits and a bit dark, all factors working in togetherness to produce a cozy feeling that is unique to him.</p>

<p>A lot of guys are in love with more than one gaming idea. What better way to ensure that the love for all keeps burning without the other feeling cheated than having it all in your room. This room contains arcade 1-up machines especially if you’re a fan of having your own arcade. Each has two to four games on it excluding the Atari 12 in one which has 12 amazing games on it. The amazing thing is that they are like real arcade rooms which gives it an original feeling. The games can be customized to suit whatever purpose you want such as adding a better rack ball and spinner, changing the buttons and joystick, readjusting or changing the light marque, replacing the internals with a PI or PC, or even changing the whole outlook.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>If you’re looking for the perfect outlook where you can stylishly display the beautiful furniture you made by yourself, then look no further. There’s a certain&nbsp;level of satisfaction and pride that comes from creating your own and displaying it in a way that clearly defines your creativity. Customized to a straight-up plug and play that can support two players. You could stock up games such as arcade 1-up, retro USB AVS, beautiful Playstation button lights, . The PS3, PS4, X-box One and X-box 360 all have PC fans installed at the back of their cubic holes to help cool off hot air which Is transported into the utility room at the back of the TV. The utility room also houses the cords and cables making it appear hidden.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This cave is very homely and can easily defeat the purpose of a living room. The dual tv setup allows for multitasking and can as well serve as a nice way to spend time with a friend and play a competitive game.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Everyone has creativity that should be expressed from time to time. This room comes as a perfect opportunity to display your love for art in a style that is both beautiful and unique to you. In a situation where you can&#8217;t create this sticker by yourself, an artist can help out, but it will be fun creating such charming stickers that will be adorning your room either alone or with the help of close friends.. An incredible appeal this room has is the cool game collections such as the digital pinball machine, the arcade machine, the nicely built shelf, the table and a tv that is just perfect for the room.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Having a man cave that doubles as a gaming room is the perfect solution for those of us who can’t bring ourselves to outgrow our love for video games (for Pete’s sake, who can?).</p>



<p>Having that room that is solely dedicated to your games without you having to bother about disturbing other people outside the room (thanks to soundproof walls that allows you to keep the volume on your sound system as high as you like it) or you being disturbed by anybody should look inviting, comfortable and definitely has a unique appeal to it.</p>

<p>Gaming is timeless. Whether you are battling it out in the vintage &#8216;Street Fighter&#8217; series or navigating your way through the modern &#8216;Fortnight Battle Royale,&#8217; playing video games is an unmatched feeling and experience. Maybe you are an impulsive teenager enjoying your summer vacations or a 30-something-year-old reminiscing about the younger, better days, either way video games are just good fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaming also presents a host of advantages. Apart from enhancing memory and coordination, it also improves your attention span and quickens your brain. Additionally, playing online with people from all across the globe, with different backgrounds, ethnicities, and beliefs, eliminates discrimination, and instills the values of love, brotherhood, and equality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a gamer, you are always looking for ways to maximize your experience. There are several factors that you might want to consider, such as the room size, speaker strength, game-reclining chair, TV/projector, and gaming TV stand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we present several ideas about setting up your game room.</p>



<h2>Less is more</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/g1x6g1/completely_reasonable_apartment_setup/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">completely reasonable apartment setup</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>You do not always need to dedicate an entire room to your gaming activities. Reddit user, <em>Wuvica</em>, shows how you can effectively utilize a limited amount of space to set up a desirable gaming system.</p>







<h2>On the go</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/7htiap/im_a_truck_driver_with_a_pc_and_a_dream/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I&#8217;m a truck driver with a pc and a dream</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>What is better than having your gaming setup? Having your gaming setup in your vehicle. With a truck set up with a computer gaming system, Reddit user, <em>BudgieBeater</em>, is living the ultimate dream of every gamer.</p>



<h2>A battlestation in a van</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/cetna0/i_live_in_a_van_and_this_is_my_battle_station/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I live in a van and this is my battle station!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Another gaming system set up inside a vehicle. If the idea of living in a van and waking up to a new scene every day is not tempting enough, add to it the pleasure of having your favorite video games at your disposal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Peaceful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/bx4csz/i_call_itserenity/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I call it&#8230;Serenity</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This setup by Reddit user <em>thedesigner2011</em> is all kinds of serene. The monitors used are Samsung CRG9 and Acer X34, while the IKBC MF87 keyboard and the Ascend Acoustics Sierra 2 speakers just add to the overall fun and experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Cool and creative</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/88mrjw/the_gum_ball_pc_tried_to_be_different_and_fun_on/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">The Gum Ball PC.

</div></figure>



<p>This is one of the most unique setups on this entire list. With multiple monitors, a gaming keyboard, and a gumball to go with, this buildup will earn applause from any dedicated gamer.</p>



<h2>Less is more</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/7y1byy/can_i_join_your_ranks/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Can I join your ranks?</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As a gamer, a private space that optimizes your focus is everything. This gaming setup by <em>Daxiongmao87 </em>shows that a genuine gamer can set up an effective gaming setup within a space that might be perhaps nonexistent to ordinary people.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bedroom setup</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/cb07be/my_setup_is_finally_finished_after_3_years_of/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My setup is finally finished after 3 years of part time job savings!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A rack full of video games, a desk lined up with a sophisticated gaming setup, a cozy-looking bed, and a TV being used as a wallpaper, is all kinds of fresh and classy. Getting your monitor to swivel towards the bed will allow you to enjoy TV shows and movies as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Combine gaming with music</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/85ikwj/my_music_gaming_room/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My Music / Gaming Room</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>This setup, belonging to Reddit user <em>Bokemoke</em>, is a dream for people who love gaming as much as they love music. To achieve the desired effect, throw in vibrant, blue lighting into the mix.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Battlestation with a view</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/b1s9fi/update_my_brooklyn_battlestation/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Update: My Brooklyn Battlestation</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It is a lie that gamers, once in front of their gaming setups, do not care about the outside world. This setup from an apartment in Brooklyn shows that a beautiful view overlooking a gaming system just adds to the overall beauty and fun.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bed away</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/8pkdt1/confined_to_bed_after_surgury_built_this_in/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Confined to bed after surgury &#8211; built this in anticipation</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>If you are one of those gamers who enjoy their games like they enjoy their games &#8211; in bed &#8211; this one&#8217;s for you. Additionally, such a setup is also beneficial for bedridden people due to an injury or a disease and need something to pass the time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Minimal but elegant</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/ecsn1u/my_minimal_setup/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My minimal setup</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Again, you do not need infinitely deep pockets to set your dream battlestation up. This setup, consisting of a whitewashed wall, a few aesthetic paintings, and a gaming computer, shows how to make the optimum use of limited resources.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Simplicity is graceful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/f1mdto/hows_my_set_up_everyone/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">How&#8217;s my set up everyone?</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Not everyone enjoys playing video games in a funkily-lighted, fancy looking game room. Sometimes, you just need a bit of calm and ease to maximize your gaming performance (especially if you are a dog).</p>



<h2>A gaming fort</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/e7cghq/the_den/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">The Den</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>A gamer does not ask for anything more than a tiny, secluded world of his own, where he can stuff all his gaming equipment, sit back and enjoy the ride. This gaming den constructed by Reddit user <em>UncleViper</em> comes pretty close to such a world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Neat and pretty</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/fz468j/simple_and_clean/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Simple and clean</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Who says that gamers are messy and disorganized? This battle station, set up by Reddit user <em>superstrm</em>, is the very definition of organized. With white-colored walls, a spotlessly clean table, and sophisticated wall-hangings, someone might easily mistake this gaming setup as an office in an organization.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Maximum experience</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/8bqfoa/screen_real_estate/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Screen Real Estate</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With a monitor that is 49.4 inches wide, this setup brings you as close to a lifelike gaming experience as you can get. Additionally, the roller skate wheels on the chair allow it to glide effortlessly across all kinds of surfaces.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Stands out</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/f9c2i6/my_wallet_and_i_are_not_talking/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My wallet and I are not talking</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With a massive HD monitor, some of the top gaming equipment, and 3D wall panels designed by Art3D, this gaming setup might cost you a few bucks but will be worth every penny.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why play in one place?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/g6nvll/living_in_a_van_doesnt_mean_you_cant_have_a_nice/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Living in a van doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t have a nice battlestation.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/">battlestations</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Yet another battle station set up in a van &#8211; well, what can we say; we are absolutely in love with the idea. Living in a van does require some vast sacrifices, but it is worth it, especially when you can be in proximity to your ideal gaming system.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>This setup allows you to keep in touch with the outside world through the vivid views that it offers.

<h2>7. Funky</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>Another kind of setup for people who wish to work without too much light seeping into the room. With the light coming from an electric candle and through the shades, this setup will make sure that you still have enough light to keep you working without hurting your eyes or head.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>10. Working from home is fun</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gwdcxt/working_from_home_here_isnt_half_bad/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Working from home here isn&#8217;t half bad</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>&nbsp;A setup which is ideal for people who work with music and musical instruments. The desk is the IKEA Barkaboda kitchen countertop, on autonomous standing legs. The guitar is from Gibson, while the speakers are Yamaha HS8, connected to a Soundrise pro monitor.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>11. Unfancy but effective</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>If you want to give your home workspace a bit of shakeup without spending too much time or money, this is one of the best ideas for you. Cleaning up your table and getting a new keyboard or a tiny table clock can go a long way in restructuring and improving your mood and attitude.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>12. Clean is not for everyone</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gyttk8/my_finally_organized_study_space_im_a_visual/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">My finally organized study space&#8211; I&#8217;m a visual person that likes to be able to see everything in its place.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Even though there are numerous people who prefer their home workspace neat and organized. However, others feel that being surrounded by work papers and other materials stimulates their productivity. This home office setup is a homage to the latter kind of workers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>13. Healthy working</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gyopsn/starting_to_come_together_just_waiting_on_a/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">starting to come together, just waiting on a back-ordered uplift desk and vertical laptop stands.</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>It is extremely important that, while working those long hours, you take care of your health and body. The huge LED monitor ensures that you do not damage your eyes by concentrating too hard, while the Steelcase Gesture chair allows you to keep a relaxed posture that your back will thank you for.</p>



<h2>14. Keep it simple</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This setup is another example of how you do not need to do anything fancy to get a working space which is effective yet aesthetic. A Hague Blue wall color by Farrow and Ball, an ‘Everything is fine’ art piece, and a spotlessly clean floor, come together to create an enviable home working area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every professional musician’s fantasy involves a nice, quiet spot to work, with a wall that holds all his precious musical instruments &#8211; this setup provides exactly that.

<h2>20. Serenity</h2>

<p>A common complaint that people working from home have, is that they are unable to find a calm spot where they can work uninterrupted. Reddit user <em>liI-xaniel</em> has provided a solution which is cheap and effective. Just choose any corner of your house, put up a desk, place your things, and fire away without any distractions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>23. Less is more</h2>

    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/gs48xo/still_waiting_on_the_new_computer_but_the_rest_is/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Still waiting on the new computer but the rest is ready to go!!</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

<p>This brilliant setup by Reddit user <em>blairnet</em>, shows us how to make the most of a not-very-large space.

<h2>24. Basements are useful</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/grr1ll/finally_got_the_basement_workplace_finished/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Finally got the basement workplace finished #Secretlab</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>House owners often consider basements a place where all the house junk, never to be used, is stashed away. However, this setup shows us how, with the right kind of effort and motivation, a basement can be transformed into a stunning and smart workplace. After all, the fact that nobody ever enters the basement, makes it the perfect spot to get your work done without being disturbed.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>25. Another minimalist design</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
    <blockquote class="reddit-card" >      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/comments/grub3p/improving_on_the_workspace_bit_by_bit/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Improving on the workspace bit by bit</a> from      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Workspaces/">Workspaces</a>    </blockquote>    <script async src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Yet another example of how you do not need an entire room to set up an effective home working space. A desktop, holding your computers and other important items, along with a wall carrying some stunning art, is more than a good enough workplace.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>26. Nice and cozy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>If you are working from home, you need to feel like you are at home &#8211; relaxed. This room provides you with a working space while keeping you at ease. When exhausted, you can lie down on the sofa; when looking for a break, you can step out on the balcony with a hot cup of coffee; when wanting to relax your tired eyes out, you can always stare at the colorful plants spread throughout the room.</p>



<h2>27. Blue is brilliant</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-reddit wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
